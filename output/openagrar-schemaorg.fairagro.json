Whole milk samples with 'best before' dates ranging from January to December 2006 were collected biweekly from supermarkets. On each sampling date, three brands from both organic and conventional production were included. In total, the dataset comprises 80 conventional and 77 organic samples, thus covering variation due to both season and production system. Consequently, the dataset accurately reflects the average fatty acid composition of milk in Germany. These data were collected as part of a project to authenticate organic milk, and they represent a full calendar year."

Alle zwei Wochen wurden Vollmilchproben mit Mindesthaltbarkeitsdaten von Januar bis Dezember 2006 aus Supermaerkten entnommen. An jedem Probenahmedatum wurden drei Marken aus oekologischer und konventioneller Produktion beruecksichtigt. Insgesamt umfasst der Datensatz 80 konventionelle und 77 oekologische Proben und deckt somit sowohl saisonale als auch produktionssystembedingte Schwankungen ab. Folglich spiegelt der Datensatz die durchschnittliche Fettsaeurezusammensetzung von Milch in Deutschland genau wider. Diese Daten wurden im Rahmen eines Projekts zur Authentifizierung von Bio-Milch erhoben und repraesentieren ein volles Kalenderjahr."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

Die FoodCASE Software ermoeglicht verschiedene Funktionalitaeten aufbauend auf dem BLS. Durch neue Algorithmen und Maschinellem Lernen soll FoodCASE verbessert werden. Zum einen soll die Ermittlung von Prozentanteilen einzelner Naehrstoffe optimiert werden. Anderseits soll die Auffindung von Lebensmitteln in der Datenbank mithilfe von Large Language Models (LLMs) verbessert werden."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. This is the main datatable which contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

We sampled bees in flowering canopies of four tree taxa: willow (Salix), apple (Malus), black locust (Robinia), linden (Tilia). Sampling took place over five sampling rounds between 4 March and 10 June 2024. We sampled bees in trees located on the JKI campus in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany, or near to the JKI campus (two apple trees; about 1km distance to the campus center). In total, 395 individuals from 34 bee species were sampled, including 247 honeybee (Apis mellifera) individuals. The list of sampled bee individuals contains information on sampling details (including sampling period, trap type, collector position, site), as well as information on the collected bee individuals (including operational taxon, determined genus and species based on morphological identification, sex). A second data sheet contains information on the location of the study sites."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

Many factors that negatively affect biodiversity are associated with agriculture. European policy instruments and measures, which aimed at mitigating these impacts, have not been successful in counteracting the negative trends of farmland biodiversity. There is a growing recognition that conservation policy instruments need to be spatially targeted, given the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes and extent of agricultural intensification in Europe. For Germany, we developed a typology of agricultural land systems (ALS) that captures the regional characteristics of agricultural intensification. For this purpose, we applied a cluster-analysis integrating indicators for land cover, landscape structure, land-use intensity, climate and relief at a resolution of with a spatial resolution of 1 km\u00b2. As a result, we present a typology of eight ALS ranging from large-scale, intensive arable farming to extensive grassland/forest mosaics in mountains. The data included in this package contain the typology ALS and the corresponding values for the indicators for each hexagonal grid cell of 1 km\u00b2cell size. The typology of ALS could be used as a spatial framework for regional targeting of conservation policy instruments and for monitoring regional-specific trends of biodiversity indicators and their drivers. The data are supplement to the publication: Pingel, M; Sietz, D; Roeder, N; Klimek, S and Golla, B.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

The purpose of HODOR is to support the development of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for marine applications, multimodal sensor fusion techniques, biomass quantification, and long-term ecological studies. The data was collected with a stationary underwater fish observatory (UFO) in the Kiel Fjord, an inlet of the Baltic Sea in northern Germany, and includes an 86-day subset of the recordings from 2021, which was selected based on automated detections using the YOLOv5 model."

It is based on statistical analysis (location sutiability) and cellular automata (neighbourhood influence). Here, we present a translated version of the original CLUMondo to Python. The core functionalities of the original model are preserved. We rely on a combination of numpy and numba for fast computation. Moreover, we present a workflow to create location suitability maps with different machine learning methods, which can be used as inputs into CLUMondo subsequently."

Die Dateien enthalten Eingangsdaten und Ergebnisse der Berechnung der THG-Emissionen und der Kohlenstoffbindung des LULUCF-Sektors fuer die Jahre 1990 bis 2023, differenziert nach Bundeslaendern. Daten wurden auf einem 100 m x 100 m Raster erhoben. Die THG-Emissionen werden ausgewiesen fuer die Hauptlandnutzungskategorien Wald, Ackerland, Gruenland, Feuchtgebiete, Siedlungen und sonstiges Land sowie diverse Subkategorien sowie fuer die Pools ober- und unterirdische Biomasse, mineralische und organische Boeden, Totholz und Streu, anthropogen beeinflusste stehende und fliessende Gewaesser. Holzprodukte und off-site Emissionen aus dem Torfabbau koennen auf Ebene der Bundeslaender nicht ausgewiesen werden."

The files contain input data and results of the calculation of GHG emissions and carbon sequestration in the LULUCF sector for the years 1990 to 2023, differentiated by federal state. Data was collected on a 100 m x 100 m grid. The GHG emissions are shown for the main land use categories forest, arable land, grassland, wetlands, settlements and other land as well as various subcategories and for the pools above and below ground biomass, mineral and organic soils, deadwood and litter, anthropogenically influenced standing and flowing waters. Wood products and off-site emissions from peat extraction cannot be reported at federal state level."

One of these new species is the broadtail shortfin squid Illex coindetii. The squid with the so far highest biomass in the North Sea is Loligo forbesii. We investigated the fatty acid (FA) composition and analysed the stomach contents to obtain information about the prey spectra of these species. Individuals of both species were caught in July and August 2023. A total of 27 I. coindetii and 14 L. forbesii were examined for the FA composition of the mantle tissue and digestive glands (DG) as well as their stomach contents. In both species, the DG contained a higher variety and a higher content of FAs than the mantle. The FA compositions of the DG suggest moderate overlap in prey spectra of I. coindetii and L. forbesii. The stomach contents of both squid species showed a high degree of dietary overlap and contained several commercially important species As the North Sea temperatures keep rising, squids are expected to play a more important role in the regional food webs, and squids are increasingly targeted as a valuable fishery resource in the North Sea."

This respository contains three documents: 1. Guidelines for conducting household-level interviews, 2. Household questionnaire template, and 3. Key informant interview template at Barangay-level. CITIZEN-SDSS is focused on fostering nature-based solutions (NBS) for sustaining and expanding the remaining forest landscapes in the Philippines by integrating local stakeholder aspirations into land use planning through spatial decision support systems (SDSS). The Philippines, with only 24% of its forest cover remaining, faces severe threats from deforestation, degradation, and climate change, despite being a global biodiversity hotspot and a vital provider of ecosystem services and livelihoods. By focusing on the Philippines, the project addresses both urgent ecological risks and pressing socio-economic needs thus, safeguarding biodiversity, supporting local communities through NBS interventions such as agroforestry, forest restoration, assisted natural regeneration (ANR), riparian buffer restoration and other sustainable land management practices. Through Citizen Science approaches and spatiotemporal modelling, CITIZEN-SDSS develops context-sensitive, scientifically rigorous pathways for sustainable land and forest management, ensuring that decision-making processes are inclusive, locally grounded, and responsive to long-term environmental and livelihood priorities."

The aim of the scoping review is to identify definitions and methodological approaches used for the quantification of substitution effects for application in a bioeconomy monitoring framework. The scoping review was conducted guided by the 27-item checklist framework indicated on the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews, PRISMA-ScR. It searched for literature in two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) using bioeconomy-related search strings and keywords and spanning twenty-two and a half years (after 1999 until 2022) of scientific literature. The final selection includes 57 peer-reviewed articles published in English. The material includes the data extraction template, identification information from each article, summarized data extracted from articles as these relate to research questions and objectives of this review, verbatim explicit and implicit definitions as these were presented in the selected articles, as well as the displacement factors (from literature or authors` estimations) employed by the authors to analyze substitution effects."

In der WGR werden in 10 Tabellen die Ressource Wald und ihr Produkt Holz von der Flaeche ueber den physischen Vorrat, dessen Wert und Nutzungen, bis hin zur Verarbeitung des Holzes in der Holzindustrie, dargestellt. Tabelle A 1a Area of wooded land in 1000 ha der WGR beinhaltet die physische Waldflaechenbilanz. Dort wird die gesamte deutsche Waldflaeche im jeweiligen Berichtsjahr, sowie die landwirtschaftliche Flaeche, die fuer die Produktion von Holz eingesetzt, abgebildet. Die Flaeche wird hierbei unterteilt nach 1.) Flaechen, die fuer die Rohholzproduktion zur Verfuegung stehen (FAWS), 2.) Flaechen, die fuer die Rohholzproduktion nicht zur Verfuegung stehen (FNAWS), 3.) sonstige Waldflaechen (in Deutschland nicht relevant) und 4.) sonstige bestockte Flaechen die fuer die Rohholzproduktion zur Verfuegung stehen (Code 3, hierunter fallen z.B. Agroforstflaechen und Kurzumtriebsplantagen). Die FNAWS-Flaeche besteht aus Waldflaechen auf denen z.B. wegen rechtlicher Beschraenkungen oder durch politische Vorgaben eine Rohholzproduktion kaum oder gar nicht moeglich ist (z.B. Stilllegungsflaechen) und aus Waldflaechen, auf denen die Wuchsleistung oder die Holzqualitaet so gering oder die Holzernte- und Holzbringungskosten so hoch sind, dass eine Rohholzproduktion kaum moeglich ist. Fuer die Berechnung der jaehrlichen Aenderungen der FNAWS-Waldflaeche in Tabelle A1a werden in den fuer Forstwirtschaft zustaendigen Ministerien der Bundeslaender jaehrlich Daten zu den Waldflaechen erhoben, auf denen im jeweiligen WGR-Berichtsjahr dauerhaft die forstliche Nutzung eingestellt wurde (Stilllegungsflaechen). Als Stilllegungsflaechen werden alle, aufgrund von gesetzlichen Schutzgebietsausweisungen dauerhaft aus der forstlichen Nutzung genommenen Waldflaechen verstanden (hierunter fallen z.B. Kernzonen von Nationalparks oder Bannwaelder)."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Molecular biodiversity surveys, such as environmental DNA (eDNA) and metabarcoding, often generate species detections that require ecological verification. eDNAcheck is an online tool designed to assess the plausibility of such detections by comparing user-provided species or genus records with reference occurrence data from global biodiversity repositories--including the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)--as well as custom datasets. The tool standardizes taxonomic, spatial, and temporal information, applies user-defined spatial and temporal buffers, retrieves matching occurrence records via the OBIS API, and summarizes results in a downloadable file accompanied by an interactive map. By highlighting ecologically plausible detections, potential range extensions, and records that warrant further scrutiny, eDNAcheck supports quality control, biodiversity monitoring, and conservation decision-making. The web-based interface requires no installation and accepts common tabular formats (.csv*, .xlsx, .tab). A global repository comparison is currently implemented, with custom-database validation in development. eDNAcheck facilitates transparent, reproducible contextualization of molecular biodiversity data, enabling researchers and practitioners to better interpret species detections in a global biogeographic framework."

This data set is an update to https://doi.org/10.3220/DATA20231117103252-0. The data are spatially resolved to 397 districts with an average size of 900 km2 and include the crops spring barley, winter barley, grain maize, silage maize, oats, potatoes, winter rape, rye, sugar beet, triticale and winter wheat. The crop-yield data cover on average about 9.5 million hectares per year and 80% of Germany's total arable land. The final dataset contains 220,850 yield and area data points. These were obtained by collecting and digitizing crop data from multiple statistical sources and transforming the data to match the district boundaries in 2020. A comprehensive description and validation of the dataset up to 2021 is published in Scientific Data by Duden et al. (2024); https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-02951-8. We therefore recommend that you also refer the Scientific Data article when using the dataset.

(2023), which provide spatially detailed global projections of potential natural vegetation (PNV) areas under three different climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) (van Vuuren et al. 2011) until 2080 (Bonnanella et al. 2023). We focus on processing these results (using TIFF files) to derive forest area estimates at the country level. The package begins with aggregating the data by country and adjusting forest definitions to match biome types and IUCN classifications, as provided in the dataset under PNV areas. The projections are converted to EPSG 8857 and then clipped with country data provided by geopandas at a 1x1 km pixel resolution. This allows us to derive country-specific areas in km\u00b2. A toolbox is included to validate the results with alternative datasets (e.g., WDI). The package offers flexibility, enabling users to analyze not only the Bonanella et al. (2023) data but also other spatial maps using Python. Additionally, we examine how forest areas within countries and continents change up to 2080, focusing on both increases and decreases across various time frames. This tool can support long-term international forest and policy modelling, similar to other projects that leverage complex datasets for future scenario analysis.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2024. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. Data and methods used to create map versions v301/2 differ from those used in previous versions. The v301/2 maps were derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v301: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v302: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. Validation: The final maps were validated using all pixels of the publicly available IACS parcels from the federal states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia that were not used for model training. Classes that are underrepresented in these federal states could therefore not be adequately evaluated (e.g., hops and grapevines). We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Note: This dataset contains the same information as 10.5281/zenodo.17190438 but with new pyramids for improved visualization. The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2024. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. Data and methods used to create map versions v301/2 differ from those used in previous versions. The v301/2 maps were derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v301: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v302: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. Validation: The final maps were validated using all pixels of the publicly available IACS parcels from the federal states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia that were not used for model training. Classes that are underrepresented in these federal states could therefore not be adequately evaluated (e.g., hops and grapevines). We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately.

The open-source software FORCE (Frantz, 2019) was used to download and preprocess all available Sentinel-2A/B scenes from February to November (2015 to 2024). A data fusion algorithm was applied to increase the spatial resolution of the 20-meter Sentinel-2 bands (B5, B6, B7, B8a, B11, B12) to a common resolution of 10 meters (Frantz et al., 2016). Clouds, cloud shadows, and hazy transition zones were detected and removed using a modified version of the Fmask algorithm (Frantz, 2019). Bare soil observations were filtered from the preprocessed time series using the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2 < 0.16) and a modified vegetation index (PV+IR2 < 0.24), proposed by Heiden et. al (2022). The soil reflectance was derived for the ten Sentinel-2 bands (B02, B03, B04, B05, B06, B07, B08, B08a, B11, B12) by calculating band-wise mean values across the filtered observations.

The cruise was part of the TRAFFIC (Trophic tRAnsfer eFFICiency in the Benguela Current) project. Samples were retrieved from vertical multinet 'Midi' hauls (200 \u00b5m mesh size) at 1 station in the nBUS (0-50 m depth) and 2 stations in the sBUS (50-100 m and 0-50 m depth respectively). In total, 3 samples were obtained from the nBUS and 6 from the sBUS. Stable isotope measurements of the copepod were then used as baseline values for further analyses in the study."

Zusaetzlich dient die Groesse der Ermittlung der Kohlenstoffspeicherung in Wald und Holz. Die amtliche Einschlagstatistik unterschaetzt den tatsaechlichen Einschlag erheblich. Ein durch das Thuenen-Institut in Zusammenarbeit mit der Universitaet Hamburg modifiziertes und weiterentwickeltes Verfahren zur verwendungsseitigen Abschaetzung der Holzeinschlaege ermoeglicht nun die Ermittlung realistischerer Jahresdaten fuer den Zeitraum von 1995 bis heute. Im Mittel werden durch die amtliche Einschlagsstatistik ueber den gesamten Betrachtungszeitraum nur etwa 81 % des tatsaechlichen Einschlages erfasst. Das bedeutet, dass durchschnittlich jaehrlich ca. 13,0 Mio. m\u00b3 Holzeinschlag nicht erfasst wurden. Die Ergebnisse der verwendungsseitigen Rueckrechnung weichen im Durchschnitt (2003 - 2012) um etwa 1,9 Mio. Kubikmeter (Erntefestmeter ohne Rinde) bzw. um ca. 2,5 % von den Ergebnissen der dritten Bundeswaldinventur (BWI3 2014) ab. Allerdings zeigt sich, dass sich der Holzeinschlag nach der amtlichen Einschlagsstatistik in den letzten Jahren zeitweise dem berechneten Holzeinschlag naehert, aber aktuell wieder deutlich niedriger liegt. Auch die Ergebnisse der vierten Bundeswaldinventur bestaetigen erneut die Ergebnisse der Thuenen-Einschlagsrueckrechnung. Eine relevante Groesse fuer die verwendungsseitige Berechnung des Holzeinschlags sind die Bestandsveraenderungen der Rohholzlager im Wald. Leider liegen hierfuer keine direkten Angaben aus Statistik oder Literatur vor. Waldlagerdaten fuer die Jahre 2003-2015 koennen aus dem Testbetriebsnetz Forstwirtschaft (TBN-Forst) des Bundes abgeleitet werden. Als Grundlage fuer die Schaetzung fuer die Jahre ab 2016 dient die enge Korrelation der Waldlager mit den Industrielagern. Es ist moeglich, dass dieser Zusammenhang gerade in den vergangenen Schadjahren ab 2018 nicht zutrifft und im Wald deutlich andere Mengen eingelagert wurden. In der Literatur bzw. aktuellen Pressemeldungen finden sich jedoch keine Hinweise auf besonders hohe Einlagerungsaktivitaeten; moeglicherweise, weil ein groesserer Teil des Schadholzes nur bedingt fuer Einlagerung geeignet oder die Wirtschaftlichkeit nicht gegeben ist. Zwar wird von hohen Schadholzmengen berichtet, jedoch bedeutet dies nicht auch einen hohen Schadholzeinschlag. Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass grosse Schadholzmengen zeitweise nicht aufgearbeitet bzw. gefaellt wurden. Fuer die aktuelle Schaetzung der Lagerveraenderungen im Wald haben wir daher die Korrelation zum Industrielager, fuer das Daten in der amtlichen Statistik vorliegen, beibehalten. Eine hoehere Einlagerung wuerde sich in der verwendungsseitigen Einschlagsrueckrechnung direkt in einer Erhoehung des Holzeinschlags auswirken, eine niedrigere Einlagerung wuerde rechnerisch eine Verringerung des Holzeinschlags bewirken. Hinweis: Aufgrund neuer Eingangsgroessen in die Berechnungen sowie der Verwendung von Regressionsmodellen aendern sich in aller Regel auch die berechneten Werte der Vorjahre."

The cruise was part of the TRAFFIC (Trophic tRAnsfer eFFICiency in the Benguela Current) project. Samples were retrieved from rectangular midwater trawl (RMT) net hauls at 10 stations in the nBUS (sampling ranged from surface down to 230-600 m) and 7 stations in the sBUS (sampling ranged from surface down to 500-750 m). Furthermore, some squids were caught using hook and line in the upper two meters of the water column at 2 stations in the nBUS (ranging from 20 to 115 min per station, 4-5 rods) and 4 stations in the sBUS (ranging from 45 to 105 min per station, 4-6 rods). At 1 station in sBUS one squid was retrieved from a neuston catamaran haul (NCAT) used to sample the surface layer (0-20 cm sampling depth). Dorsal mantle length (DML) of each specimen was measured to the nearest mm below. This data set contains the results of the fatty acid trophic marker analyses of squid mantle muscle and midgut gland (MGG) tissue of 84 specimens. A modified carnivory index after Bode et al. (2015) was determined and ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. Differences in fatty acid compositions displayed distinct clusters separating squid families and different prey taxa through principal component analyses."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This preliminary version is based on all available satellite data until August 2025 (*_2025_08). The map will be updated when more data are available. Note: This dataset holds the same information as 10.5281/zenodo.17182293 but with new pyramids for improved visualization. The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2025. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. Data and methods used to create map versions v301/2 differ from those used in previous versions. The v301/2 maps were derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v301: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v302: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. Validation: The final maps were validated using all pixels of the publicly available IACS parcels from the federal states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia that were not used for model training. Classes that are underrepresented in these federal states could therefore not be adequately evaluated (e.g., hops and grapevines). We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately.

While enrichment has the potential to enhance welfare, its effects on fish immune function remain unclear. This study examined whether enrichment modulates the immune system beyond welfare benefits. Growth (length, weight, and Fulton's body condition factor - K), immune parameters (leukocyte counts and respiratory burst activity), and serum markers (cortisol, myeloperoxidase, antiprotease, lysozyme) were assessed in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, n = 240). Trout (20 per aquarium, initial weight: 9.84 \u00b1 0.77 g) were reared for 48 days in four conditions: horizontal (H) (gravel), vertical (V) (rubber cords), combined (VH), or a control (no enrichment, C) in 60 L glass aquaria (40 cm \u00d7 40 cm \u00d7 40 cm). Immune cell counts, including monocytes and lymphocytes, were significantly lower in enrichment setups compared to the C setup (p < 0.05), whereas spontaneous respiratory burst activity, although higher in enrichment setups, did not differ significantly. Growth and organ weights were unaffected by enrichment, except for a lower hepatosomatic index in VH. No differences in serum markers were detected between setups. In conclusion, the V setup acts as an immunomodulator by reducing immune cell counts in rainbow trout but not affecting its respiratory burst activity. Disease resistance experiments are necessary to determine whether these immune changes affect susceptibility to infections, which is critical for assessing practical implications of V setup in aquaculture and research."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This preliminary version is based on all available satellite data until August 2025 (*_2025_08). The map will be updated when more data are available. Note: This dataset holds the same information as 10.5281/zenodo.17181503 but with new pyramids for improved visualization. The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2025. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. Data and methods used to create map versions v301/2 differ from those used in previous versions. The v301/2 maps were derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v301: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v302: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. Validation: The final maps were validated using all pixels of the publicly available IACS parcels from the federal states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia that were not used for model training. Classes that are underrepresented in these federal states could therefore not be adequately evaluated (e.g., hops and grapevines). We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Soil organic carbon is an effective measure to remove and store CO2 and is one of the few available large-scale CO2 sinks that could help mitigate climate change. The amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a balance of the carbon input from plants and organic amendments and the carbon output due to mineralisation. A reduction in N fertilisation, as proposed by the F2F strategy, decreases the plant growth which leads to lower C input in form of above- and belowground harvest residues. Based on estimated yield reductions from WP3 from -20% mineral N fertilisation, we derived the corresponding loss in carbon input and its impact on soil organic carbon after 30 years. European scale simulations were performed for the six major crops wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, potatoes and sugar beet. Given the lack of data on how/if plant carbon allocation changes under nitrogen reduction, two common allocation functions were applied, each of them coupled to a version of the widely applied soil organic carbon model RothC that has been calibrated with the respective allocation function. The 20% reduction of mineral nitrogen results in mean European SOC losses of 0.9 t per hectare of agricultural land, mainly caused by wheat and rapeseed cultivation due to the big share in agricultural area and high yield reductions, respectively. Czechia (-2.2 t SOC/ha), United Kingdom (-1.7 t SOC/ha) and Slovakia (-1.6 t SOC/ha) suffer the major losses, due to large shares of high-yielding crop in their agricultural areas. The SOC simulations reveal an overall moderate impact of Farm-to-Fork nitrogen reductions on European SOC due to the six major crops. However, in some countries, these crops cover less than 20% of total agricultural land and, therefore, the real impact in these regions will be -much- higher than our results show."

The control plot had a size of 1 m\u00b2 and was approximately 2-5 m away from the edge of the colonized area. General site conditions in the control regarding slope and exposure preferably matched the sample plot in the colonized area. In May and June 2021, three soil samples were taken within a 1 m\u00b2-plot, each in an area within the nesting sites, where a high nest density could be found, and the corresponding control using a drill core. Soil cores were subdivided into the depths of 0-15, 15-30, 30-45 and 45-60 cm and the three samples per depth were lumped for either the aggregation or the control, respectively. Combined samples were analysed regarding proportion of dry matter, soil skeleton, total carbon and nitrogen, as well as pH, conductivity, potassium, phosphorus, and soil texture. A detailed method description of the soil analyses can be found in the attached PDF document. The table includes columns for the Study site ID (both aggregation and control plots) Geolocation for each study site Plot type (aggregation & control) Depth of the soil sample Proportion of dry matter Proportion of nitrogen (N) Proportion of carbon (C) Carbon-to-nitrogen-ratio (C/N ratio) pH value Conductivity Available potassium (K2O) Available phophorus (P2O5) Weight of the total air dried soil sample Weight of the soil skeleton (> 2 mm) Weight of the sieved fraction (< 2mm) Proportion of soil skeleton Proportion of coarse sand (0.63 - 2 mm) Proportion of medium sand (0.2 - 0.63 mm) Proportion of fine sand (0.063 - 0.2 mm) Proportion of coarse silt (0.02 - 0.063 mm) Proportion of medium and fine silt (0.002 - 0.02 mm) Total proportion of sand (0.063 - 2 mm) Total proportion of silt (0.002 - 0.063 mm) Proportion of clay (<0.002)"

One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ). Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD and LOQ for the Heubach method. For the conditioning of the testing device seeds from sugar beet and barley were used. After several test series conducted ahead the procedure for measuring blank values was refined and specified regarding the cleaning of the equipment and the correct weighing. Two Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_barley_sugar_beet_refined_procedure.xlsx) were performed following the 'Assessment of free floating dust and abrasion particles of treated seeds as a parameter of the quality of treated seeds' (Version 1.1; published by Euroseeds SCTP Dust working Group on 23.03.2011). The material and methods used are described in the file 'Material_and_methods_refined_procedure_sugar_beet_and_barley.pdf' and the procedure for estimation of LOD and LOQ for Heubach seed abrasion dust method is described in the file 'Refined_procedure_for_the_estimation_of_LOD_and_LOQ_sugar_beets_and_barley.pdf'."

Hintergrund ist der erwartete Anstieg von Vorratsschaedlingen in Koernerschuettguetern infolge zunehmender Jahresmitteltemperaturen durch den Klimawandel. Ziel des Projekts ist die Entwicklung einer resilienten, oekonomisch und oekologisch nachhaltigen Lagertechnik fuer Getreide, um zukuenftige Nachernteverluste, steigenden Vorratsschutzaufwand und hoehere Lagerkosten zu minimieren. Hierzu zaehlen unter- und oberirdische hermetisch luftdichte Lager mit passiver Kuehlung zur Kontrolle von Temperatur und Insektenbefall. Die Datenerhebung erfolgte anhand von Praxis- und Pilotanlagen unterschiedlicher Bauart: \u2022 Hermetische Faesser, Saecke (\u201eBags'), Grossbeutel fuer BigBags (\u201ePouches') \u2022 Schutzverpackungen fuer Saecke (\u201eCocoon') und BigBags aus Vakuumierfolie (\u201eVacPack') \u2022 Rundsilos (Edelstahl, GFK und Beton) \u2022 Zusaetzliche Erprobung von Siloschlaeuchen am Standort Brandenburg Zur oekonomischen Bewertung des Technologiewechsels wurde ein praxisnaher Datensatz zur Getreidelagerung in Deutschland erstellt, welcher auf Daten von 600 Lagern, erhoben mittels Online-, persoenlichen und telefonischen Befragungen beruht. Im Datensatz werden folgende Lagerungsformen fuer Getreide unterschieden: Flachlager, Rundsilo, Kornhaus, Folienschlauchlager und andere Lagerungsformen wie BigBag-, Boxen-, Fass-, Sacklager oder Textilsilo. Viele Standorte kombinieren mehrere Lagertypen. Insgesamt wurden an den 600 untersuchten Getreidelagerstandorten 24 unterschiedliche Kombinationen dieser Lagerungsformen erfasst. Neben hermetischen Folienschlaeuchen beinhaltet der Datensatz acht Pilotanlagen des JKIs. Insgesamt wird an 73 Standorten hermetisch gelagert. 73 % der Teilnehmenden lagern konventionell, 16 % biologisch, und 11 % nutzen beide Verfahren. Der Datensatz enthaelt Lager mit Lagerkapazitaeten zwischen 1,8 und 800.000 Tonnen im Jahr. Insgesamt koennen an den 600 Lagerstandorten knapp 8 Millionen Tonnen Getreide gelagert werden. Ergaenzende Fachgespraeche ermoeglichten die Ermittlung von realistischen Durchschnittswerten zu Betriebsmittelverbrauch, Arbeitszeitbedarf und Lagerungsverlusten - insbesondere bei Betrieben mit eingeschraenkter Differenzierung zwischen Lagerguetern und Betriebsbereichen. Basierend auf den erhobenen Daten, Preislisten (2023/24), weiteren Fachgespraechen sowie statistischen Quellen wurden die Investitions- und Betriebskosten der verschiedenen Lagerformen zum Preisniveau 2023/ 2024 berechnet. Der Datensatz ermoeglicht die Skalierung hermetischer Pilotanlagen auf unterschiedliche Kapazitaeten und die Modellierung alternativer Szenarien. Beantwortet wurden bislang folgende Leitfragen: 1. Ab wann sind hermetische Lager oekonomisch gegenueber konventionellen vorzuziehen? 2. Sind mobile hermetische Gebinde (z. B. Saecke, Folien) gegenueber festen Lagerstrukturen vorzuziehen? Die Datenerhebung zur Charakterisierung von Getreidelagern erfolgte im Zeitraum von Oktober 2022 bis Oktober 2024 auf Grundlage eines einheitlichen Fragenkatalogs mit offenen Antwortmoeglichkeiten. Dieser wurde fuer jeden befragten Getreidelagerstandort verwendet. Bei den Befragungen kamen verschiedene Erhebungsmethoden zur Anwendung: Telefonische und persoenliche Interviews (CAPI, CATI - Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing and Computer As-sisted Telephone Interview), Begehungen der Standorte (20), Online-Treffen, eine Online-Umfrage (CAWI - Computer Assisted Web Interviewing - mittels Google Forms). Um eine hohe Anzahl vollstaendig beantworteter Fragenkataloge zu erhalten, wurden die Erhebungsmethoden teilweise mehrmals angewendet oder auch kombiniert. Die oekonomische Kostenberechnung basiert auf den Umfrageergebnissen unter Nutzung betrieblicher Daten, Preislisten sowie Auswertung statistischer Informationen."

Root carbon inputs have been shown to contribute 3-5 times more to soil organic carbon than aboveground plant carbon. We examined the biomass data from ten wheat varieties that were sampled at nine sites across Europe and derived allocations functions to investigate the potential of wheat variety selection on soil organic carbon on a European scale. Five versions of the widely applied SOC model RothC were applied that differed in the decomposition rates for straw and root carbon inputs: the standard RothC version, two versions calibrated for root and straw input, and two versions that were derived in Task 6.1 and take into account the observed three times higher SOC efficiency with two different dynamics in the RothC model (elevated root 1. resistance to decomposition and 2. carbon use efficiency). Each of the ten varieties' impact on SOC after 50 years was simulated applying their straw and root carbon input compared to the standard variety (defined as the ten-variety average) carbon input. Surprisingly, the maximum and minimum root varieties showed on average over all five RothC versions similar SOC changes and these changes were negative (-0.057 and -0.031 t SOC/ha). The maximum biomass variety performed best with a mean SOC gain of 0.383 t after 50 years and per hectare of European agricultural land (1.277 t SOC/ha in monoculture). The simulation results show that focussing on root biomass alone might result in increased root-derived SOC but might overall even lose soil organic carbon compared to the standard variety due to less above ground biomass carbon input to the soils."

Sampling was conducted every Monday and Thursday, always three hours after sunrise. After enrichment with solid phase extraction, 1307 samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Additional to the dataset included here, the same samples were analyzed for prokaryotic and eukaryotic community composition (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), cell abundances (flow cytometry), and physico-chemical environmental parameters."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This preliminary version is based on all available satellite data until August 2025 (*_2025_08). The map will be updated when more data are available. The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2025. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. Data and methods used to create map versions v301/2 differ from those used in previous versions. The v301/2 maps were derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v301: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v302: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. Validation: The final maps were validated using all pixels of the publicly available IACS parcels from the federal states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia that were not used for model training. Classes that are underrepresented in these federal states could therefore not be adequately evaluated (e.g., hops and grapevines). We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately.

Since the past drought years of 2018-2022, it has become clear that the climatic changes have consequences for water availability and use. The results of this development are local water scarcity and restrictions on private or agricultural water use. This leads to temporal regional water use conflicts between water management and agriculture. As a result, the topic of agricultural water management has also moved up the political agenda. A large proportion of agricultural water demand is attributable to irrigation (irrigation demand). Due to the heterogeneity of agriculture in Germany, and the spatial differences in the factors that determine irrigation demands, it is necessary to analyse the entire country at the smallest possible scale, and with a high temporal resolution. Only a comprehensive regional analysis provides the necessary data, and a decision-making basis, to counter future water use conflicts. However, this contrasts with the actual availability of data on irrigation in Germany. This discrepancy between data availability and data demand for water management concerns needs to be filled up. Agricultural statistics are an important source of information on the actual spatial distribution of irrigation characteristics. In the agricultural census (full survey) data is collected on the location, legal form, land use, livestock and also on irrigation from agricultural holdings. The given dataset presents area-wide information from the agricultural censuses (German: 'Landwirtschaftszaehlung') for the years 20091 and 20192 on a NUTS-3-level. The data was requested from the German Research Data Centre (German: 'Forschungsdatenzentrum') and was grouped using a cluster analysis to comply with the statistical confidentiality and privacy of the surveyed farms as stipulated in the Federal Statistics Act (German: 'Bundestatistikgesetz'). Information on various variables (irrigation areas and volumes, crops irrigated, techniques used and the origin of water for irrigation). Based on this data, a report on the status quo of irrigation in Germany was compiled (source). The report was compiled as part of the joint research project LAWAMAD (Agricultural Water Management Germany) at the Johann Heinrich von Thuenen Institute. 1 RDC of the Federal Statistical Office and Statistical Offices of the Federal States of Germany, DOI: 10.21242/41141.2010.00.00.1.1.0, own calculations. 2 RDC of the Federal Statistical Office and Statistical Offices of the Federal States of Germany, DOI: 10.21242/41141.2020.00.00.1.1.0, own calculations."

Spaetestens seit den Duerrejahren 2018-2022 ist deutlich geworden, dass die klimatischen Aenderungen Folgen fuer die Wasserverfuegbarkeit und Wassernutzung bedeuten. Ergebnisse dieser Entwicklung sind oertliche Wasserknappheiten, mit Einschraenkungen der privaten oder landwirtschaftlichen Wassernutzung, und regionale Wassernutzungskonflikte zwischen Wasserwirtschaft und Landwirtschaft. Dadurch rueckt auch das Thema Landwirtschaftliches Wassermanagement auf die politische Agenda. Ein grosser Teil des landwirtschaftlichen Wasserbedarfs ist auf die Bewaesserung zurueckzufuehren. Aufgrund der Heterogenitaet der Landwirtschaft in Deutschland und der raeumlichen Unterschiede der Faktoren, die den Bewaesserungsbedarf bedingen, ist eine moeglichst kleinraeumige und zeitlich hochaufgeloeste Betrachtung fuer das gesamte Bundesgebiet notwendig. Nur eine flaechendeckende und regionale Betrachtung liefert die notwendige Daten- und Entscheidungsgrundlage, um zukuenftig auftretenden Nutzungskonflikten zu begegnen. Dem gegenueber steht jedoch die tatsaechliche Verfuegbarkeit von Daten zur Bewaesserung in Deutschland. Dies zeigt sich in einer Diskrepanz zwischen Datenverfuegbarkeit und Datenbedarf. Eine wichtige Quelle fuer Informationen zur raeumlichen Verteilung von Bewaesserungsmerkmalen, ist die Agrarstatistik. In der Landwirtschaftszaehlung (Vollerhebung) werden durch Befragung landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe Daten zur Lage, Rechtsform, Bodennutzung, Viehbestaenden und auch zur Bewaesserung erfasst. Die vorliegenden Daten liefern deutschlandweit flaechendeckende Informationen der Landwirtschaftszaehlungen fuer die Jahre 20091 und 20192 Die Daten wurden beim Forschungsdatenzentrum abgefragt und durch eine Cluster-Analyse gruppiert, um dem - im Bundesstatistikgesetz festgesetztem - Statistikgeheimnis und der Geheimhaltung betrieblicher Informationen der befragten Betriebe gerecht zu werden. Der Datensatz enthaelt Informationen zu den Merkmalen Bewaesserungsflaeche und -menge, bewaesserten Kulturen, verwendete Bewaesserungstechnik und Herkunft des Bewaesserungswassers. Basierend auf diesen Daten wurde ein Bericht ueber den Status Quo der Bewaesserung in Deutschland verfasst (Quelle).

Die Thuenen-Baseline ist ein Basisszenario und beschreibt die zukuenftige Entwicklung der Agrarmaerkte unter definierten politischen und wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Zentrale Annahmen sind die Beibehaltung der derzeitigen Agrarpolitik und Umsetzung bereits beschlossener Politikaenderungen sowie die Fortschreibung exogener Einflussfaktoren auf Basis historischer Trends. Die Berechnungen beruhen auf Daten und Informationen, die bis zum Fruehjahr 2024 vorlagen. Dargestellt werden Projektionsergebnisse fuer Agrarhandel, Preise, Nachfrage, Produktion, Einkommen und Umweltwirkungen. Die Darstellung der Ergebnisse konzentriert sich hauptsaechlich auf die Entwicklungen des deutschen Agrarsektors bis zum Jahr 2034 im Vergleich zum Durchschnitt der Basisperiode 2020\u20112022. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die EU ihre Position im weltweiten Agrarhandel bis zum Jahr 2034 behaupten kann. Die Preise fuer Agrarprodukte sinken zu Beginn der Projektionsperiode vom hohen Niveau des Basisjahres, koennen sich bis zum Jahr 2034 jedoch wieder erholen. In Deutschland entwickelt sich der Anbau von Getreide ruecklaeufig, was auf veraenderte Preiserelationen sowie einen Rueckgang der landwirtschaftlich genutzten Flaeche zurueckzufuehren ist. Im Tiersektor setzt sich der in den letzten Jahren beobachtete Abbau der Tierbestaende und Rueckgang der Fleischerzeugung fort, insbesondere in der Schweinehaltung, wohingegen die Gefluegelfleischerzeugung bis zum Jahr 2034 noch leicht waechst. Eine positive Preisentwicklung am Milchmarkt in Verbindung mit einer weiteren Steigerung der Milchleistung fuehren ausserdem zu einem moderaten Anstieg der Milchanlieferungen. Das durchschnittliche reale Einkommen landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe geht ueber die Projektionsperiode um 17 Prozent zurueck und liegt damit im Jahr 2034 wieder auf dem mittleren Niveau der letzten zehn Jahre."

As one of the main consequences, a shift in the distribution of species is observable in many marine areas, resulting in the formation of new species communities and new interactions. In the North Sea, the squid community has changed considerably over the last 100 years. Some species have disapeared while new species have established and are now living in coexistence in a new community. Although squids are considered to be predators that feed rather non-selectively, we aimed to answer the question of whether their diet differs nevertheless. Therefore, we analysed the fatty acids of three squid species whose distribution substantially overlaps. We were able to recognise a dependence between the size of the squid and the composition of fatty acids and are able to demonstrate the already known ontogenetic shift in food composition on the basis of fatty acid composition. Furthermore, we illustrate that the fatty acid composition differs significantly between squid species, which points to different prey of the analysed squid species and which may be one reason for their successful coexistence."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The Forest Agreement Layer (FAL) is a set of open access Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts that merges global forest datasets (currently up to 9) into one single map, separating steps requiring user input from automated tasks. The term forest agreement refers to a multi-source blend of global forest and tree-cover datasets to highlight where maps agree or disagree on forest/tree cover. A FAL can be for example used for due diligence purposes relating to the Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR), as it refers to the cut-off year and the definitions set out in the regulation. It can also be used to monitor compliance with deforestation-free requirements that fall outside the scope of the EUDR, or for other purposes defined by the user, e.g., using other maps at landscape, national or administrative-level. The approach builds on the work of Freitas Beyer et al. (2025), who identified eight datasets as particularly well suited for compliance verification under the EUDR. The current version of the collection extends this foundation by adding a ninth dataset Global Forest Types 2020, v0 (Bourgoin et al., 2024) which is available through the JRC portal and the Google Earth Engine catalog. The current FAL product here remains closely aligned with the criteria defined in the original study by Freitas Beyer et al. (2025). However, as the Global Forest Types 2020 dataset was released after the article's final compilation in November 2024, it could not be included in their assessment. Nevertheless, the GEE script allows users to expand the nine currently curated datasets according to their FAL needs or data requirements."

(2024) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.10.008 Residues of two commonly used fungicides (boscalid and pyraclostrobin) were measured in several bee matrices along a transfer pathway from plants to larvae. The samples were collected simultaneously at five different locations in Germany (Bochum, Braunschweig, Celle, Hohenheim, Veitshoechheim) from spring 2022 to spring 2023. Therefore a field study was carried out in which honey bee colonies were placed to oilseed rape (Brassica napus, OSR) fields. The formulation Pictor(R) Active was applied to the treatment field site according to label instructions at the maximum field recommended rate of 1 L (product)/ha. No applications were conducted at a second field site, which was designated as the negative control. Samples of plant inflorescences, honey bee pollen baskets, honey sacs, stored pollen and nectar, in-hive bees, larval food jelly (royal, worker, and drone jelly), and larvae (queen, worker, and drone larvae) were collected in a time dependent interval and analyzed for residues of the active ingredients. The data set contains all raw data of the measured residue concentrations within each sample. Detailed information about the sampling and methodology can be found in the corresponding publication."

In this context, samples from agricultural biogas plants in Lower Saxony were examined with regard to the composition and abundance of the microbial communities (bacteria and archaea) and a possible correlation with the organic substrates used, the process parameters and the nutrients was investigated. The abundance of bacteria and archaea was determined by quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA genes from DNA of the fermenting substrates independent of cultivation and the diversity was determined by DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes using Illumina MiSeq technology. Overall, the available data set of nine biogas plants is not sufficient to derive a reliable correlation between the microbiological and abiotic parameters on its own. There were no indications of a possible occurrence of C. botulinum. However, the data set can contribute to a better understanding of the influence of fermentation substrates and process conditions on the composition of the microbiome in biogas plants in a larger context with further sampling of biogas plants."

We answer this question using a sample of Spanish municipalities from the Madrid region for the period 2010\u22122019. The Madrid region has a homogenous set of budget rules that allows consistently categorising budget expenditure items as either 'mandatory' or 'non-mandatory' public services. After differentiating between smaller and larger municipalities, gender influence is studied along two dimensions: mayor's sex and share of women in government. Our findings include, in regard to mandatory spending in smaller municipalities, that gender-balanced governments induce PBCs. In larger municipalities, when the share of women in government is above 60%, electoral spending is increased by up to 10% of an average municipal budget for mandatory spending, and up to 2.2% for non-mandatory. These findings are generally supported in a mixed-gender close election analysis."

The time series used for the stock assessment dates back to 1992. During the entire spawning season, i.e. from mid-February to the end of June,36 stations in the Strelasund/Greifswalder Bay are sampled weekly. The herring larvae are caught quantitatively using a bongo net (mesh size 335 \u00b5m). In addition, hydrographic parameters such as water temperature, salinity, Secchi depth/water turbidity and dissolved oxygen content are recorded. The RHLS usually comprises around 600 ichthyoplankton samples, which are processed in extensive laboratory work."

Spectra were measured on the surface of solid wood samples and correlated with the simultaneously determined air concentration of Terpenes from the same samples. For the \u03b1-pinene and 3-carene, which are mainly emitted from pine wood, prediction models were created using Partial Least Squares Regression. Both working with determination coefficients of 0.77 and RMSEP of 12 % max. To test the predictive capability of multiple substances simultaneously from an NIR recording, a model based on the sum of the two terpenes was built and tested. The model performs slightly worse, with a determination coefficient of 0.72 and an error of 13 % max. Despite continuously expanding the data sets for multiple models, no better metrics could be achieved, likely due to the heterogeneous structure of wood when scanning the solid wood surface. Systematic deviations were found in particularly low reference ranges, which may indicate a non-linearity in the relationship between terpenes and the NIR signal."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The German Fruit Genebank (https://www.deutsche-genbank-obst.de/) is a decentralized network dedicated to coordinating various germplasm collections across Germany. The aim is to conserve and utilize the genetic resources of native fruit species, i.e. pear. For effective conservation, the investigation of authenticity of the genetic resources is essential. Between 2019 and 2023, two projects were performed on the pear collections of the German Fruit Genebank to characterize the cultivars pomologically and molecularly. Eight partners of the pear network of the German Fruit Genebank participated in the projects. First, at least two experts of the Fruit Orchard Agency Schlaraffenburg (Schlaraffenburger gGmbH, https://schlaraffenburger.de/) identify the pear cultivars pomologically and define the authentic cultivar name per tree and accession. Second, 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and seven reference genotypes in recommendation of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) Malus/Pyrus working group were used for genetic fingerprinting. The molecular analysis, including experimental work and statistical analysis for grouping the genetic profiles based on similarity, was performed by Microsynth ecogenics GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). The pomological and molecular data was compiled and resulted in 1,838 complete samples. The most important data features per sample are the cultivar name, the authenticity expressed by the trueness-to-type criterion, the molecular group and the genetic profile. Lastly, the individual samples were collated into unique, synthetic genetic profiles per distinguished pear cultivars with the help of a computer program and manual review. Mutations and sports of cultivars cannot be distinguished molecularly, but only pomologically and are grouped within the origin cultivar as they carry the same molecular group but different cultivar names. In total, 420 pear cultivars with corresponding genetic fingerprints were identified and evaluated for their authenticity as part of the German Fruit Genebank as presented in the published dataset. Additionally, the genetic fingerprints were aligned to international datasets to assign the Pyrus UNiQue genotype code (PUNQ). To evaluate the certainty of the synthetic genetic profiles, a quality ratio was calculated per genetic locus and on average where the consensus across samples is reflected."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This preliminary version is based on all available satellite data until August 2025 (*_2025_08). The map will be updated when more data are available. The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2025. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. Data and methods used to create map versions v301/2 differ from those used in previous versions. The v301/2 maps were derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v301: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v302: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. Validation: The final maps were validated using all pixels of the publicly available IACS parcels from the federal states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia that were not used for model training. Classes that are underrepresented in these federal states could therefore not be adequately evaluated (e.g., hops and grapevines). We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately.

Honey bee colonies can buffer short-term stressor effects of pollen restriction and fungicide exposure on colony development and the microbiome (DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116723). A total of 128 honey bee colonies were subjected to a Germany-wide field trial, during which they were exposed to combined stressors, namely fungicide exposure and pollen restriction, from April 2022 to April 2023. The parameters of colony development and brood development were recorded over the course of the bee season, while microbiome data was collected during the treatment phase. Colony population estimates were conducted at three-week intervals, commencing with the blooming of the oilseed rape field. Brood assessment was performed during the treatment phase, with the first brood cycle. In-hive bees and forager bees were collected before, during, and after the treatment phase, and their gut microbiomes were analyzed for abundances of five core species. Additionally, plant flowers of the oilseed rape were collected and analyzed for nectar-inhabiting yeast species. All parameters can be found in separate data tables accompanied by an explanatory metadata file. Dataset comprises of five individual data tables a) Data of honey bee colony assessments from spring to autumn 2022 (Population_data.xlsx), b) Data of honey bee overwintering success (Overwintering_Data.xlsx), c) Data of honey bee brood assessment of the first brood cycle within treatment period (Brood_Data.xlsx), d) qPCR data to determine the core microbiome bacterial abundances (Microbiome_Data.xlsx), e) Data of nectar yeast abundances of rape seed flowers (Nectaryeast_Data.xlsx). Further information about the experimental setup can be found in the corresponding publication (doi: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116723)."

In file Data_Exp_1_pw.csv the pupal weight of a group of these test individuals is given as an additional information. In file Data_Exp_2.csv, data on survival of moths from the laboratory strain in a feeding experiment under field conditions in the year 2017 are given. The file Data_explanation.csv summarizes details on the various parameters in the experiments, such as treatment factors (diet, populations), levels of co-variables (sex, year, pupal or adult moth weight) and response variables (fecundity determined as eggs per female; survival measured in days or calculated as Accumulated Degree Days)."

Auf den Feldern, die sich in Bodentextur (Lehm und Ton) und Bodenbearbeitung (konservierend und konventionell) unterschieden, wurden landwirtschaftliche Massnahmen nach herkoemmlicher Praxis betrieben. Um Einflussfaktoren zu untersuchen, wurden parallel meteorlogische Daten und physikochemische Bodeneigenschaften erfasst (pH Wert, Gehalte an organischen Kohlenstoff und Gesamt-Stickstoff). Zur mikrobiologischen Charakterisierung wurde Boden-DNA mit PCR Verfahren untersucht. Die Abundanz wurde mit quantitativer PCR (qPCR) bestimmt, die Vielfalt mit der Sequenzierung von PCR Produkten mit Hilfe der IlluminaMiSeq Technologie."

On three neighboring fields of a farm near Hildesheim, the abundance and diversity of the soil microbiological community was recorded in a 14-day time grid over a period of 2 years. On the fields, which differed in soil texture (loam and clay) and tillage (conservation and conventional), agricultural measures were carried out according to conventional practice. In order to investigate influencing factors, meteorological data and physicochemical soil properties were recorded in parallel (pH value, organic carbon and total nitrogen content). For microbiological characterization, soil DNA was examined using PCR methods. The abundance was determined with quantitative PCR (qPCR), the diversity with the sequencing of PCR products using IlluminaMiSeq technology."

In order to be as representative as possible for the entire country, samples were generated with the help of an elaborate sampling plan. Another highlight of this study is also the use of the latest and advanced dietary fiber method AOAC 2011.25. Further details on the experimental setup, sample collection, and applied methodologies can be found in the linked publication. Indication of 'n.a.' in the data table indicates that information is either not available or not applicable. These data are intended to serve the scientific community as a basis for evaluating these products and are also available for consumption studies analysis."

The model can be used to predict cumulative emission and emission rate of ammonia following field application of slurry. Predictions may be useful for emission inventory calculations, fertilizer management, assessment of mitigation strategies, or research aimed at understanding ammonia emission. Default parameter sets include effects of application method, slurry composition, and weather. The model structure is based on a simplified representation of the physical-chemical slurry-soil-atmosphere system. See Hafner et al. (2018) for information on the model and Hafner et al.

Most of these data refer to raw commodities (RAC) because maximum residue levels established under European legislation reflect pesticide residues only in the RAC. However, food processing operations can have decisive effects on pesticide residue levels and therefore consumer exposure. This database has been developed to compile validated processing factors for pesticide residues in food in line with the EFSA food classification and description system (FoodEx2). This update fixes a problem that caused some median processing factors to display a '<' qualifier when it was not necessary. The calculated values for the processing factors were not affected by this error and remain unchanged from the previous release"

It can accumulate in filter-feeding shellfish, thereby reaching the human food chain. In addition to inducing severe gastrointestinal symptoms, OA can pass the intestinal barrier into the bloodstream, thereby reaching the liver. However, the effects of OA on the liver have not been much in the focus of research so far. Therefore, this study now focuses on elucidating changes in the proteome of HepaRG cells induced by OA. Furthermore, as a potent phosphatase inhibitor, we expected changes in the phosphoproteome of the cells. Therefore, we further investigated the phosphoproteome of the HepaRG cells after OA exposure. Results revealed changes in enzyme activity regulation, cytoskeleton organization and energy metabolism."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The fungal pathogen Diplocarpon coronariae, the causal agent of apple blotch, poses a significant challenge in organic apple production and meadow orchards across Europe. One potential measure to restrict the spread of the disease is cultivating resistant varieties. However, understanding the reproduction and pathogenicity of the fungus is crucial for maintaining apple resistance. The recently sequenced Chinese isolate NL1 indicates that secondary metabolites play a role in host colonization. Furthermore, the rapid adaptation of the fungus to environmental conditions, including resistance, depends on sexual reproduction. While the fungus is capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually, in Europe, only asexual reproduction has been observed. The presence of alternative forms (idiomorphs) plays a crucial role in the mating of heterothallic fungi like D. coronariae. Chinese strains have been observed to exhibit the presence of two idiomorphs (MAT1.1 and MAT1.2). At present, no sequence of a European isolate is available for analysis. This study provides the first European draft genome sequence of the D. coronariae strain (DC1_JKI) from Dresden, Germany. The final draft contained 22 scaffolds with a total length of 51.5 Mbp and an N50 of 4.0 Mbp. The BUSCO analysis of genome completeness was 98.5%. Additionally, a second isolate from Japan (NBRC 30405) was sequenced for comparison of the genome. Using long-read sequencing technologies, the DNA from DC1_JKI and NBRC 30405 was sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION. To polish the sequences, Illumina NovaSeq sequencing (NovaSeq 6000 S4 PE150 XP) was conducted for short reads. The draft genome sequence was assembled using Canu software, resulting in the genome sequence of DC1_JKI. The data on this platform comprise 20 files. Two genome sequences have been processed. The European assembly is available in the file 'genome_DC1_JKI.fasta' and the Japanese assembly in 'genome_NBRC30405.fasta'. The final European genome sequence was first annotated using BRAKER 1 and BRAKER 2 and the masked genome sequence, detected repetitive elements, genome annotation features, protein sequences and coding sequences are available from this collection (genome.fa.masked.gz, genome.fa.out.gz, genome.fa.tbl.gz, Diplocarpon_coronariae-families.fa.gz, Diplocarpon_coronariae-families.stk.gz, Br2_tsebra.gtf.gz, Br2_tsebra.aa.gz, Br2_tsebra.codingseq.gz). The functional annotation of was performed with InterProScan (interproscan.tsv.gz; interproscan.gff3.gz). GeMoMa pipeline was used to predict gene models using three reference datasets from species of the genus Drepanopezizaceae and two species of the order Helotiales in combination with the incorporation of the annotation from BRAKER1 and BRAKER 2. Finally the protein sequences (Galaxy32-[GeMoMa_NBRC30405_canu].fasta, Galaxy18-[GeMoMa_DC1_JKI].fasta) and the genome annotation features (Galaxy31-[GeMoMa_NBRC30405_canu].gff, Galaxy17-[GeMoMa_DC1_JKI].gff) are available from this data collection for both genome sequences. Additionally, the genomic sequences from the mitochondria of both isolates D. coronariae from Dresden (DC1_JKI) and Japan (NBRC 30405) are provided (tig00000019_Mito_DC1_JKI.fa, GeSeqJob-20240105-133611_tig00000019_Mito_DC1_JKI.gff3, tig00000344_Mito_NBTC30405.fa, GeSeqJob-20240105-134830_tig00000344_Mito_NBRC30405.gff3)."

A major concern is that biota, including fish, are negatively affected by toxic explosives leaking into marine environments. With the present study, we investigated fish living in close proximity to munition dumping sites for contamination and for signs of health impairments. The flat fish species common dab (Limanda limanda) was used as a model, since it lives in the vicinity of dumping sites and exhibits minor migratory activity. Since explosives are excreted via the bile, the bile fluids from dab were analyzed. Further on we inspected the health status of the fish. Indeed, dab caught in German coastal waters of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea were contaminated with explosives. Probably due to rapid metabolization, concentrations of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were always below limit of detection, but its metabolites 2-amino-4,6-dinitrolouene and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrolouene were detected in bile fluid up to 26.36 ng/ml and 95.91 ng/ml respectively. Only few fish from the Baltic Sea were positive for the explosive HMX, octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine with a maximum concentration of 0.89 ng/ml. Highest concentrations of TNT metabolites in bile fluid were detected in dab collected near the dumping site 'Kolberger Heide' in the bay of Kiel (Baltic Sea). However, also dab from the North Sea were significantly contaminated with TNT-metabolites. The present study showed for the first time that fish living close to near shore munition dumping sites in the North Sea are contaminated with explosives. Various health indicators (body condition factors, externally visible fish diseases, parasites or liver anomalies) showed differences in health status between fish living in the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea respectively. However, the health status of fish caught at the most contaminated site in the Baltic Sea was not worse compared to fish living in less contaminated areas. We conclude that fish living in the vicinity of dumping sites in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea can be significantly contaminated with explosives. However, obvious health impairments of the fish were not observed."

The insect's sound level spans from very loud Bombus terrestris, to inaudible to human ears Aphidoletes aphidimyza. The samples were extracted from more than 1000 h of recordings made in an anechoic box with a four-channel low-noise measurement microphone array. Each sample is a four-channel wave-file of 2500 ms length, at 16 kHz sample rate and 32 bit resolution. Acoustic insect recognition holds great potential to form the basis of a digital insect sensor. Such sensors are desperately needed to automate pest monitoring and ecological monitoring. With its significant size and high-quality recordings, InsectSound1000 can be used to train data-hungry deep learning models. Used to pre-train models, it can also be leveraged to enable the development of acoustic insect recognition systems on different hardware or for different insects. Further, the methodology employed to create the dataset is presented in detail to allow for the extension of the published dataset."

The absence of N2 flux measurements in liquid manure-amended soils has resulted in a poor understanding of the effect of manure application on gaseous N losses. The aim of this study was to quantify N2, N2O, CO2, N2O reduction to N2, depth distribution of moisture, water-extractable organic C, NO3-, NH4+, pH, and diffusivity in a laboratory incubation experiment with an arable silt-loam soil. To quantify N processes and gaseous fluxes, 15N tracing was applied. An artificial livestock slurry-mixture was added to the soil in various treatments (control, surface or injected application; slurry application rate: 42.9 kg N ha-1; soil water content of either 40% or 60% water-filled pore space (WFPS)). The soil was incubated for 10 days. The depth distribution of the control parameters was measured twice during the experiment on days 5 and 10. The average increase in N2 and N2O fluxes from denitrification was about 900% in slurry-amended soils. The highest N2 and N2O fluxes from denitrification were measured in the slurry injection, 60% WFPS treatment (7.83 \u00b1 3.50 and 11.22 \u00b1 7.60 mg N m-2 2 d-1, respectively). The hypothesis that injected slurry at a higher water content enhances denitrification was confirmed. This study provides important insights into the formation, spatial and temporal variation of the manure-soil hotspot and its impact on the denitrification process. The results will form part of a dataset to develop, improve and test manure application submodules of biogeochemical models and will help to understand in detail the effect of hotspots on N-cycling in manure-treated soils.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Food authenticity is a highly relevant topic for the entire food supply chain from the raw material to the final product. Compliance with raw material specifications and food product related legal requirements (e.g. labelling, marketing) is also mandatory for guarantee food authentication. This is all the more correct if the food is subject to certain restrictions, for example cultural or religious issues. In addition, some manipulations of food also involve health risks. Therefore, the assurance of food authenticity, with the active involvement of all parties involved in the supply chain, has a significant impact on the perception of general legal certainty. This review reports a systematic literature survey based on the topics food authenticity and mass spectrometry in combination with the food groups cereals, fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, beans, edible oils, spices, herbs, meat, seafood, milk, egg, honey, insects. Special attention was paid to the demands of the official food control authorities, concerning method development and validation aspects, as well as the improvement of data evaluation. The review shows a great need for fully validated, routine-capable and standardized methods as well as for the development of food data systems using artificial intelligence where reasonable to prevent food authenticity crises in future."

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2022. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

Whether viable hybrids are produced will most likely depend on the level of genomic divergence and associated genomic incompatibilities between the different entities as well as environmental conditions. By taking advantage of historical Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) otolith samples combined with genotyping and whole genome sequencing, we here investigate the genetic impact of the increased spawning stock biomass of the eastern Baltic cod stock in the mid 1980s. The eastern Baltic cod is genetically highly differentiated from the adjacent western Baltic cod, and locally adapted to the brackish environmental conditions in the deeper Eastern basins of the Baltic Sea unsuitable for its marine counterparts. Our genotyping results show an increased proportion of eastern Baltic cod in western Baltic areas (Mecklenburg Bay and Arkona Basin) - indicative of a range expansion westwards - during the peak population abundance in the 1980s. Additionally, we detect high frequencies of potential hybrids (including F1, F2 and backcrosses), verified by whole genome sequencing data for a subset of individuals. Analysis of mitochondrial genomes further indicates directional gene flow from eastern Baltic cod males to western Baltic cod females. Our findings unravel that increased overlap in distribution can promote hybridization between highly divergent populations, and that the hybrids can be viable and survive under specific and favourable environmental conditions. However, the observed hybridization had seemingly no long-lasting impact on the continuous separation and genetic differentiation between the unique Baltic cod stocks."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Ausdehnungen des Verbreitungsgebiets koennen zu einem verstaerkten Kontakt zwischen unterschiedlichen Populationen fuehren und damit das Potenzial fuer Hybridisierungsereignisse erhoehen. Ob lebensfaehige Hybriden entstehen, haengt hoechstwahrscheinlich vom Grad der genomischen Divergenz und den damit verbundenen genomischen Inkompatibilitaeten zwischen den verschiedenen Einheiten sowie von den Umweltbedingungen ab. Anhand historischer Otolithenproben des Ostseedorsches (Gadus morhua) in Kombination mit Genotypisierung und Ganzgenomsequenzierung untersuchen wir hier die genetischen Auswirkungen des Anstiegs der Biomasse des oestlichen Ostseedorsches als Laichfisch Mitte der 1980er Jahre. Der oestliche Ostseedorsch unterscheidet sich genetisch stark vom benachbarten westlichen Ostseedorsch und ist lokal an die brackigen Umweltbedingungen in den tieferen oestlichen Becken der Ostsee angepasst, die fuer seine marinen Gegenstuecke ungeeignet sind. Unsere Genotypisierungsergebnisse zeigen, dass der Anteil des oestlichen Ostseedorsches in den westlichen Ostseegebieten (Mecklenburger Bucht und Arkonabecken) waehrend des Hoehepunkts der Populationsdichte in den 1980er Jahren gestiegen ist, was auf eine Ausdehnung des Verbreitungsgebiets nach Westen hinweist. Ausserdem stellen wir eine hohe Haeufigkeit potenzieller Hybriden (einschliesslich F1, F2 und Rueckkreuzungen) fest, was durch Ganzgenomsequenzierungsdaten fuer eine Untergruppe von Individuen bestaetigt wird. Die Analyse der mitochondrialen Genome zeigt ausserdem, dass der Genfluss von maennlichen Dorschen der oestlichen Ostsee zu weiblichen Dorschen der westlichen Ostsee gerichtet ist. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass eine zunehmende Ueberlappung der Verbreitungsgebiete die Hybridisierung zwischen stark voneinander abweichenden Populationen foerdern kann und dass die Hybriden unter bestimmten, guenstigen Umweltbedingungen lebensfaehig sein und ueberleben koennen. Die beobachtete Hybridisierung hatte jedoch scheinbar keine dauerhaften Auswirkungen auf die kontinuierliche Trennung und genetische Differenzierung zwischen den einzelnen Dorschbestaenden der Ostsee."

It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. The map was derived from time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and additional environmental data. Map production is based on the methods described in Blickensdoerfer et al. (2022). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v202: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, small woody features, heathland or peatland according to ATKIS Basis-DLM 2020 (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG (2020)). Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM. The final post-processing step comprises the aggregation of the gridded data to homogeneous objects (fields) based on the approach that is described in Tetteh et al. (2021).

Mapping and assessing the status and use intensity of grasslands is thus important for environmental monitoring. We here provide maps with detected mowing events, as a proxy for grassland use intensity, for grassland areas across Germany for the year 2022. The dataset contains maps of grassland mowing activity in Germany, which have been produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire grassland area, i.e. permanent grassland, potentially permanent grassland (e.g. fodder crops) and other extensive areas. They are derived from dense time series of Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 (and 9) data. Map production is based on the methods described in Schwieder et al. (2022). The algorithm used to derive the maps is available as a user-defined function for the FORCE environment (Frantz, D., 2019). The dataset includes seven layers: (1) the number of detected mowing events, (2) the day of year (DOY) of the first to sixth detected mowing event. Ancillary data layers are available on request. The maps include all areas that have at least once been classified as permanent grassland, cultivated grassland or fallow in the maps of agricultural land use between 2017 and 2021 that are provided by Thuenen Institute.

It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning in 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and, e.g., uncultivated areas. The generation of the maps involved four steps. Firstly, a raster map was derived from a time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and additional environmental data following the approach of Blickensdoerfer et al. (2022). Secondly, agricultural field boundaries were generated based on monthly composites of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images using the approach of Waldner et al. (2021). Thirdly, the agricultural fields were spatially overlaid on the raster map, and the class per field was assigned via majority voting. Finally, all the fields were simplified to remove redundant vertices while preserving essential shape. All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). The maps are available in FlatGeobuf format, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL to the datasets that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

In the datasheet Data-LOD-LOQ-ZR (3) the Weight delta for Lab C, Employee B, Seed Lot 1, Number of measurement 8 had to be corrected (see in the datasheet, test 2, Column H, Line 110) correct is -0,00006 (former value: 0,00006). In the datasheet Data-LOD-LOQ-ZR (3) the Weight delta for Lab C, Employee B, Seed Lot 2, Number of measurement 9 had to be corrected (see in the datasheet, test 2, Column H, Line 121) correct is 0,00005 (former value: 3,00005). With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of LOD and LOQ. Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for the Heubach method. Three Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021). The material and methods used are described in Material_and_Method.pdf and the procedure for estimation of LOD and LOQ for Heubach seed abrasion dust method is described in Procedure_for_the_estimation_of_LOD_and_LOQ_sugar_beets.pdf."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2024. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. The data and methods used to create this map differ from those used in previous versions. The map was derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v202: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

Man findet sie in der Umwelt zum Beispiel in der Naehe von Haefen oder Schifffahrtsrouten. Zur Gruppe der PAH gehoeren auch krebserregende Substanzen. Fische metabolisieren PAH sehr schnell, so dass PAH selbst in Fischen kaum nachweisbar sind, wohl aber ihre Metaboliten in der Galle des Fisches. Die Gehalte von PAK-Metaboliten in Meeresfisch werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thuenen-Instituts fuer Fischereioekologie regelmaessig ueberwacht, um die Hoehe der PAK-Belastung indirekt zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen. Die Ergebnisse fliessen in nationale und europaeische Umweltbewertungen ein. Die Daten sind Teil des Monitorings im Thuenen-Institut fuer Fischereioekologie und sind als solche ueber die ICES-Datenbank Dome oeffentlich zugaenglich. Erlaeuterungen zu den ICES Codes in der angehaengten Datei findet man hier: https://www.ices.dk/data/vocabularies/Pages/default.aspx"

In der Studie wurde das Potential zur Steigerung des Bodenkohlenstoffvorrats durch die Neuanlage von Hecken auf Ackerstandorten untersucht. Werden Hecken neu angelegt, kann zusaetzlich CO2 in der aufwachsenden Biomasse und im Boden langfristig gebunden werden. Hecken haben damit grosses Potential zum Klimaschutz beizutragen. An 23 Standorten in Deutschland wurden die Bodenkohlenstoffvorraete in einem gepaarten Beporbungsansatz (Hecke und Acker) untersucht. Der Datensatz enthaelt die Labordaten aller Einzelproben der Studie (Drexler_Don_2024_Data) sowie die berechneten Bodenkohlenstoffvorraete der Bohrkerne (Drexler_Don_2024_SOC_Stock_Per_Core)."

During the expedition, eDNA samples were collected from various marine locations and subsequently processed for metabarcoding using the MiFish primers, which target a specific region of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in fish. The resulting eDNA sequences were generated on the Illumina MiSeq platform, producing high-quality fastq files. This dataset provides critical metadata, including sequencing reads, quality scores, which are essential for studying the spatial and temporal patterns of fish diversity. The comprehensive eDNA dataset serves as a valuable resource for ecological and conservation research, enabling the identification of fish species and the monitoring of marine ecosystems with high resolution and accuracy."

Die daraus resultierenden eDNA-Sequenzen wurden auf der Illumina MiSeq-Plattform generiert, wobei hochwertige fastq-Dateien erzeugt wurden. Dieser Datensatz enthaelt wichtige Metadaten, darunter Sequenzierungslesezeichen, Qualitaetsbewertungen und taxonomische Anmerkungen, die fuer die Untersuchung der raeumlichen und zeitlichen Muster der Fischvielfalt unerlaesslich sind. Der umfassende eDNA-Datensatz ist eine wertvolle Ressource fuer die Umwelt- und Naturschutzforschung und ermoeglicht die Identifizierung von Fischarten und die Ueberwachung von Meeresoekosystemen."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2024. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. The data and methods used to create this map differ from those used in previous versions. The map was derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v202: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

Gehalte von PFAS in Meeresfisch sind oft in der Naehe der analytischen Nachweisgrenze. Die Gehalte werden im Rahmen des Umwelt-Monitorings des Thuenen-Instituts fuer Fischereioekologie regelmaessig ueberwacht, um die Hoehe der Belastung zu erfassen und zu bewerten sowie regionale und zeitliche Unterschiede in dieser Belastung festzustellen.

In der WGR werden in 10 Tabellen die Ressource Wald und ihr Produkt Holz von der Flaeche ueber den physischen Vorrat, dessen Wert und Nutzungen, bis hin zur Verarbeitung des Holzes in der Holzindustrie, dargestellt. Tabelle A 1a Area of wooded land in 1000 ha der WGR beinhaltet die physische Waldflaechenbilanz. Dort wird die gesamte deutsche Waldflaeche im jeweiligen Berichtsjahr, sowie die landwirtschaftliche Flaeche, die fuer die Produktion von Holz eingesetzt, abgebildet. Die Flaeche wird hierbei unterteilt nach 1.) Flaechen, die fuer die Rohholzproduktion zur Verfuegung stehen (FAWS), 2.) Flaechen, die fuer die Rohholzproduktion nicht zur Verfuegung stehen (FNAWS), 3.) sonstige Waldflaechen (in Deutschland nicht relevant) und 4.) sonstige bestockte Flaechen die fuer die Rohholzproduktion zur Verfuegung stehen (Code 3, hierunter fallen z.B. Agroforstflaechen und Kurzumtriebsplantagen). Die FNAWS-Flaeche besteht aus Waldflaechen auf denen z.B. wegen rechtlicher Beschraenkungen oder durch politische Vorgaben eine Rohholzproduktion kaum oder gar nicht moeglich ist (z.B. Stilllegungsflaechen) und aus Waldflaechen, auf denen die Wuchsleistung oder die Holzqualitaet so gering oder die Holzernte- und Holzbringungskosten so hoch sind, dass eine Rohholzproduktion kaum moeglich ist. Fuer die Berechnung der jaehrlichen Aenderungen der FNAWS-Waldflaeche in Tabelle A1a werden in den fuer Forstwirtschaft zustaendigen Ministerien der Bundeslaender jaehrlich Daten zu den Waldflaechen erhoben, auf denen im jeweiligen WGR-Berichtsjahr dauerhaft die forstliche Nutzung eingestellt wurde (Stilllegungsflaechen). Als Stilllegungsflaechen werden alle, aufgrund von gesetzlichen Schutzgebietsausweisungen dauerhaft aus der forstlichen Nutzung genommenen Waldflaechen verstanden (hierunter fallen z.B. Kernzonen von Nationalparks oder Bannwaelder)."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Plankton dynamics in temperate ecosystems have been mainly studied during productive seasons, with comparatively less research conducted during the winter, particularly on microplankton. Implementing plankton sampling during a regular fishery cruise, we investigated the North Sea micro- and mesozooplankton community composition, abundance and size structure (55-2000 \u00b5m) during autumn (Buchan/Banks area) and winter (Downs area) between 2013 and 2019. Samples were analyzed using image-based techniques. Community diversity (broad taxa) was relatively similar across years in both areas, with diatoms and tripos taxa sets dominating the microplankton community and gastropods and copepods the mesozooplankton one. The average micro- to mesoozooplankton ratio (in abundance) was 90:1 for Buchan/Banks, resulting in average Normalized Abundance Size Spectra (NASS) slopes of -1.45 \u00b10.18 SD. For Downs, the micro- to mesoozooplankton ratio was 235:1 and steeper NASS slopes of -1.67 \u00b10.20 SD due to a lower contribution of large organisms. Interannual changes in the planktonic community for each area and their potential environmental drivers were examined using a redundancy analysis (including taxonomy and size) and a correlation analysis using NASS slopes (size only). Both approaches highlighted the importance of water mass properties (e.g. salinity, temperature, turbidity) in shaping plankton dynamics, although the amount of explained variance differed between approaches (11 versus 46%). Our results contribute to a better understanding of standing stocks of plankton and their environmental drivers. Specifically, novel insights were gained into microplankton dynamics, which play an important role in supporting the growth and survival of winter-spawned fish larvae in the North Sea."

Food fraud along the production chain is a well-known issue that requires an effective authenticity control. For the differentiation of fresh and frozen-thawed fish, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy based methods in combination with multivariate data analysis have proven to be suitable in principle. Here, from a total of 317 samples (cod, rainbow trout, mackerel; fresh and frozen-thawed), the lipid and polar fractions of the fish flesh were analyzed, and classification models based on a principal components analysis with linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) including cross-validation were generated. Additionally, data fusions were carried out. The obtained average accuracies of > 90% (94.0% based on the lipid fraction, 92.8% based on the polar fraction) and > 95% (95.6% based on a low-level data fusion, 95.5% based on a mid-level data fusion) demonstrated a promising differentiation. Further examinations confirmed that the non-targeted analysis appears to be mandatory as no marker substances were indicated in the loadings plots of the models. To evaluate whether the generated classification models are suitable to be used in a broader manner, they were applied to 13 fresh and 13 frozen-thawed samples from twelve other common edible fish species in a preliminary study. The classification model based on the low-level data fusion gave the best results (84.6% of all 26 samples correctly predicted). Thus, although these models are very suitable for analyzing cod, rainbow trout, or mackerel for a classification as fresh or frozen-thawed, they cannot generally be applied to samples of other fish species. Datasets containing NMR spectra of samples from the classification models and of samples from other fish species are provided, as well as relevant metadata."

Agroforstflaechen und Kurzumtriebsplantagen). Die FNAWS-Flaeche besteht aus Waldflaechen auf denen z.B. wegen rechtlicher Beschraenkungen oder durch politische Vorgaben eine Rohholzproduktion kaum oder gar nicht moeglich ist (z.B. Stilllegungsflaechen) und aus Waldflaechen, auf denen die Wuchsleistung oder die Holzqualitaet so gering oder die Holzernte- und Holzbringungskosten so hoch sind, dass eine Rohholzproduktion kaum moeglich ist. Fuer die Berechnung der jaehrlichen Aenderungen der FNAWS-Waldflaeche in Tabelle A1a werden in den fuer Forstwirtschaft zustaendigen Ministerien der Bundeslaender jaehrlich Daten zu den Waldflaechen erhoben, auf denen im jeweiligen WGR-Berichtsjahr dauerhaft die forstliche Nutzung eingestellt wurde (Stilllegungsflaechen). Als Stilllegungsflaechen werden alle, aufgrund von gesetzlichen Schutzgebietsausweisungen dauerhaft aus der forstlichen Nutzung genommenen Waldflaechen verstanden (hierunter fallen z.B. Kernzonen von Nationalparks oder Bannwaelder)."

The flat fish species common dab (Limanda limanda) was used as a model, since it lives in the vicinity of dumping sites and exhibits minor migratory activity."

Seven distinct assemblages characterized by water mass, oxygen concentration in the surface layer, and chlorophyll concentrations between 50 and 100 m were identified. In 2021 in austral winter, 15 stations were analyzed, of which 7 belonged to sBUS and 8 to nBUS."

This might impact C cycling both at the ecosystem and microform scale in multiple ways, but so far, data is lacking. We established two sites in the same former peat extraction area, one showing permanently high WL and mire-specific vegetation (Open site, OS), while the other one has more fluctuating WL and a dense birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) population (Tree site, TS). We measured the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at ecosystem (eddy covariance) and plot scale (chamber measurements) for one year to clarify the differences between the sites and the impact of birch encroachment on the contribution of the different bog-specific microforms to the ecosystem's CO2 balance. Overall, the OS had a CO2 balance of -262.4 \u00b1 7.8 g CO2-C m-2 yr-1 indicating CO2 uptake, while the TS was close to neutral (-28 \u00b1 5.1 g CO2-C m-2 yr-1). The smaller uptake at the TS was caused by higher (151%) ecosystem respiration, while gross primary production was only 15% difference. However, the microform contributions to C uptake strongly differed: At the OS, both hummocks and hollows showed net uptake, while at the TS, most C (52%) was assimilated by the birches and the understory was a net CO2 source. This indicates a loss of peat C from the TS, while the successfully rewetted site was accumulating new peat. Accounting for plot-scale CH4 fluxes, both sites were a weak source of greenhouse gases, but a distinctly stronger C sink occurred at the OS. Our data shows the possibility to increase C removal from the atmosphere by full rewetting and the establishment of mire-specific vegetation."

The study is based on a data corpus of 1,957 newspaper articles published between 2019 and July 2023, mainly in peatland-rich regions of Germany. We focus our investigation on the influence of regionality on the public sensemaking about peatland rewetting. Due to the large scope of the analysis, we used Structural Topic Modeling (STM) as a technique to identify discursive features and meaning structures. The data provided here are supplementary material to the analysis. We provide a commented code that makes the data preprocessing and analysis steps transparent. Furthermore, we publish datasets containing the metadata of the newspaper articles and the probabilities to which they are assigned for each of the 35 calculated topics used for the interpretation."

Die Kosten sind in die Hauptkategorien Administration, bauliche Umsetzung und jaehrlich Kosten untergliedert. Innerhalb dieser Kategorien erfolgt eine weitere Differenzierung nach einzelnen Kostenkomponenten. Die Differenzierung ist notwendig, da die Ausgangssituation der Flaechen und die Nachnutzung Kosten in verschiedener Hoehe verursachen koennen. Weiterhin ist auch nicht jede einzelne Komponente in jedem Projekt notwendig. Zur Abbildung moeglicher Skaleneffekte sind die Kosten fuer drei Groessenklassen ausgewiesen. Die Kosten werden ausserdem in Form von Spannen dargestellt; einen Minimalwert, den Durchschnittswert sowie einen Maximalwert."

All satellite images were processed with the FORCE framework. The resulting maps provide information on the number and timing of grassland-management events at a spatial resolution of 10 m \u00d7 10 m for the whole of Switzerland. For the final maps, permanent grasslands were masked using a variety of land-use layers, according to Huber et al. (2022) but replacing the crop mask with the agricultural-use data from the cantons. We assessed the detection of management events based on independent reference data, which we acquired from daily time series of publicly available webcams that are widely distributed across Switzerland. We further tested the ecological relevance of the generated intensity measures in relation to nationwide biodiversity data (see Weber et al., 2023). The webcam-based reference data used for verification was subsequently added on 14.02.2024."

The additional static covariates are provided in static.tif. The file SOC_prediction_raster.tif contains eight layers with the corresponding SOC maps from 1986 to 2021. The generated SOC trend map, based on these predictions, is provided in SOC_trends_raster.tif. 'Layers SRC_1986.tif - SRC_2021.tif': See Model features (2) 'Layers SOC_prediction_raster.tif': SOC predictions from 1986 to 2021 in g kg-1 'Layer SOC_trends_raster.tif': Derived SOC trend from 1986 to 2021 (Pearson r, multiplied by 1000) 2. Code (1) Model training and validation: The R code SOC_model.Rmd contains details on the implementation and validation of the spatiotemporal SOC model. The SOC reference data (SOC_data.csv) is combined with the model features for each sampling year and Field_ID (training_data.csv) to conduct a support vector machine (SVM) and 10-fold cross-validation. The cross-validation is repeated for all SRC pixels intersecting the LTM plots (LTM_data.csv) to derive and validate the SOC trends, based on the long-term SOC measurements. (2) Prediction of the SOC trend map: The R code SOC_map.Rmd contains details on the production of the SOC maps, based on the spatiotemporal SOC model and the dynamic SRC, located in SRC_1986.tif - SRC_2021.tif. The individual SOC maps from 1986 to 2021 (SOC_prediction_raster.tif) are combined the derive the final SOC trend map for the research area (SOC_trends_raster.tif)"

A major concern is that biota, including fish, are negatively affected by toxic explosives leaking into marine environments. With the present study, we investigated fish living in close proximity to munition dumping sites for contamination and for signs of health impairments. The flat fish species common dab (Limanda limanda) was used as a model, since it lives in the vicinity of dumping sites and exhibits minor migratory activity. Various health indicators (body condition factors, externally visible fish diseases, parasites or liver anomalies) were investigated."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) is an economically valuable target species in the North Sea. Although individual Nephrops populations are scattered, the crustacean is managed regionally by the European Union (EU). The spatial competition for fisheries in the North Sea is growing especially due to expanding offshore wind farms (OWF) and newly implemented marine protected areas (MPA). Moreover, the Brexit affects the availability of EU fishing quotas and adds to the overall uncertainty EU fishers face. We compare landings and catches to scientifically advised quantities and perform an overlap analysis of fishing grounds with current and future OWFs and MPAs. Furthermore, we explore the German Nephrops fleet using high-resolution spatial fishing effort and catch data. Our results confirm earlier studies showing that Nephrops stocks have been fished above scientific advice. Present OWFs and MPAs marginally overlap with Nephrops fishing grounds, whereas German fishing grounds are covered up to 45% in future scenarios. Co-use strategies with OWFs could mitigate the loss of fishing opportunities. Decreased cod quotas due to Brexit and worse stock conditions, lowers Germany's capability to swap Nephrops quotas with the UK. We support the call for a new management strategy of individual Nephrops populations and the promotion of selective fishing gears."

Das auf Sentinel-2-Satellitendaten basierende Waldschadenerfassungssystem ermoeglicht differenzierte Veraenderungs- und Schadanalysen fuer die vier Untersuchungsgebiete des Projektes, die in Sachsen, Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Wuerttemberg liegen. In dem vorliegenden Datensatz sind die jaehrlichen Waldschaeden, die jeweils im Zeitraum vom 01.09. bis 31.08. erkannt wurden, als Jahresprodukte von 2018 bis 2022 zusammengestellt. Der Stichtag der Produkte ist jeweils der 31.08.. Die Genauigkeit der Jahresprodukte wurde nach Stehman (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207) auf Basis stichprobenbasierter Validierungen berechnet. Dabei erreichen die Produkte eine Gesamtgenauigkeit im Bereich von \u2265 95%. Die Jahresprodukte wurden nur fuer bestockte Waldflaechen, d.h. innerhalb der bestockten Holzbodenflaeche (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221205151218) berechnet. Im Anschluss wurden die Ergebnisse mit der deutschlandweiten Baumartenkarte (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221214084846) verschnitten. Fuer jede Schadflaeche wird der Stichtag, die Flaeche in Hektar und die dominierende Baumart nach Blickensdoerfer (2023) angegeben. Die Jahresprodukte als Ergebnisse des Projektes FNEWs bieten umfassende Anwendungsmoeglichkeiten fuer Forstwirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Politik. Die Einordnung der Schaeden wird als Basis fuer die forstliche Planung, politische Massnahmen und die Modellierung weiterer Faktoren genutzt. Auf Basis der Jahresprodukte wurde darueber hinaus eine oekonomische Bewertung der Waldschaeden im Projekt durchgefuehrt. Fuer weitere Informationen wenden Sie sich bitte an fnews@thuenen.de.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "In the project Remote Sensing Based National Forest Damage Assessment System (FNEWS), forest damage is assessed on the basis of a structural time series model in combination with the Kalman filter. The forest damage monitoring system based on Sentinel-2 satellite data enables change and damage analyses for the four study areas of the project, which are located in Saxony, Lower Saxony, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the presented data set, the annual forest damage detected in each case in the period from 01.09. to 31.08. is provided as annual products from 2018 to 2022. The reference date of the products is 31.08. for each product. The accuracy of the annual products was calculated according to Stehman (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207) on the basis of sample-based validations. The products achieve an overall accuracy in the range of \u2265 95%. Annual products were calculated only for stocked forest areas, i.e. within the stocked forest area (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221205151218). Finally, the results were intersected with the Germany-wide dominant tree species map (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221214084846). Each damaged area is given the reference date, the area in hectares and the dominant tree species according to Blickensdoerfer (2023). The annual products as results of FNEWS offer substantial application potential for forestry, science and politics. The classification of damage is used as a basis for forest planning, political measures and the modelling of further factors. On the basis of the annual products, an economic evaluation of forest damage was also carried out within the project.

Das auf Sentinel-2-Satellitendaten basierende Waldschadenerfassungssystem ermoeglicht differenzierte Veraenderungs- und Schadanalysen fuer die vier Untersuchungsgebiete des Projektes, die in Sachsen, Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Wuerttemberg liegen. Fuer die jaehrliche Kartierung von Waldschaeden wird jeweils zum Stichtag 31.08. ein wolkenfreies Kalman-gefiltertes Sentinel-2 Bild (KFB) in einer CIR-Falschfarbendarstellung erzeugt. Die Kalman-Filterung bewirkt, dass atmosphaerische Stoereinfluesse unterdrueckt werden und gleichzeitig der Zustand am Boden moeglichst wirklichkeitsgetreu im KFB abgebildet wird. Die KFB sind die Datengrundlage fuer die Ableitung der FNEWs-Jahresprodukte (https://doi.org/10.3220/DATA20230907171359-0) . Hier werden die Sentinel-2 KFB aus den Jahren 2017 bis einschliesslich 2022 zur Verfuegung gestellt. Sie koennen allgemein als Hintergrund-Layer verwendet werden oder speziell bei der Interpretation der FNEWS Jahresprodukte helfen. Die KFB werden als COG - cloud optimized GeoTIFF zum Download bereitgestellt. Bei Verwendung der KFB sind folgende Einschraenkungen zu beruecksichtigen: Waldaenderungen sind moeglicherweise noch nicht oder noch nicht in ihrer vollen Auspraegung im KFB abgebildet, wenn sie zeitlich erst kurz vor dem Stichdatum eingetreten sind. Das strukturelle Zeitreihenmodell ist auf Wald optimiert, d.h. ausserhalb des Waldes ist mit groesseren Abweichungen zu rechnen."

Daten fuer die Fortwirtschaft werden Berechnungen entsprechend des European Forest Accounts (TI-WF) entnommen. Fuer alle anderen Wirtschaftszweige werden amtliche Daten des Statistischen Bundesamtes (Destatis) verwendet. Ab dem Berichtsjahr 2021 liegt den verwendeten Daten der EU-Unternehmensbegriff und nicht mehr das Unternehmen als rechtliche Einheit zugrunde. Weiterhin wird zusaetzlich die Bruttowertschoepfung zusaetzlich auf Basis der Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnung auch preisbereinigt bereitgestellt. Die amtlichen Daten sind unter den Codes 48112 (Bereichsuebergreifende Unternehmensstatistik) und 81000 (VGR des Bundes) unter https://www-genesis.destatis.de/datenbank/online abrufbar.

Moreover, the Brexit affects the availability of EU fishing quotas and adds to the overall uncertainty EU fishers face. We compare landings and catches to scientifically advised quantities and perform an overlap analysis of fishing grounds with current and future OWFs and MPAs. Furthermore, we explore the German Nephrops fleet using high-resolution spatial fishing effort and catch data. Our results confirm earlier studies showing that Nephrops stocks have been fished above scientific advice. Present OWFs and MPAs marginally overlap with Nephrops fishing grounds, whereas German fishing grounds are covered up to 45% in future scenarios. Co-use strategies with OWFs could mitigate the loss of fishing opportunities. Decreased cod quotas due to Brexit and worse stock conditions, lowers Germany's capability to swap Nephrops quotas with the UK. We support the call for a new management strategy of individual Nephrops populations and the promotion of selective fishing gears."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) is an economically valuable target species in the North Sea. Although individual Nephrops populations are scattered, the crustacean is managed regionally by the European Union (EU). The spatial competition for fisheries in the North Sea is growing especially due to expanding offshore wind farms (OWF) and newly implemented marine protected areas (MPA). Moreover, the Brexit affects the availability of EU fishing quotas and adds to the overall uncertainty EU fishers face. We compare landings and catches to scientifically advised quantities and perform an overlap analysis of fishing grounds with current and future OWFs and MPAs. Furthermore, we explore the German Nephrops fleet using high-resolution spatial fishing effort and catch data. Our results confirm earlier studies showing that Nephrops stocks have been fished above scientific advice. Present OWFs and MPAs marginally overlap with Nephrops fishing grounds, whereas German fishing grounds are covered up to 45% in future scenarios. Co-use strategies with OWFs could mitigate the loss of fishing opportunities. Decreased cod quotas due to Brexit and worse stock conditions, lowers Germany's capability to swap Nephrops quotas with the UK. We support the call for a new management strategy of individual Nephrops populations and the promotion of selective fishing gears."

The timespan for the satellite observations is from July 2015 to October 2022 and BOA reflectance is labelled with tree species, diameter of the stem measured at a height of 1.3 m, height of the tree, area of the crown as projected to the ground, and additional variables. The dataset contains about 83 million data points from about 360.000 trees covering all environmental conditions in Germany. As reference for geolocation, the centre of the closest 1 km cell of the INSPIRE grid to the corresponding sampling unit of the NFI was used. The exact locations of the sampling units and individual tree positions are confidential.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2024. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. The data and methods used to create this map differ from those used in previous versions. The map was derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images. Map production is based on the methods described in Pham et al. (2024). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v202: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) is an economically valuable target species in the North Sea. Although individual Nephrops populations are scattered, the crustacean is managed regionally by the European Union (EU). The spatial competition for fisheries in the North Sea is growing especially due to expanding offshore wind farms (OWF) and newly implemented marine protected areas (MPA). Moreover, the Brexit affects the availability of EU fishing quotas and adds to the overall uncertainty EU fishers face. We compare landings and catches to scientifically advised quantities and perform an overlap analysis of fishing grounds with current and future OWFs and MPAs. Furthermore, we explore the German Nephrops fleet using high-resolution spatial fishing effort and catch data. Our results confirm earlier studies showing that Nephrops stocks have been fished above scientific advice. Present OWFs and MPAs marginally overlap with Nephrops fishing grounds, whereas German fishing grounds are covered up to 45% in future scenarios. Co-use strategies with OWFs could mitigate the loss of fishing opportunities. Decreased cod quotas due to Brexit and worse stock conditions, lowers Germany's capability to swap Nephrops quotas with the UK. We support the call for a new management strategy of individual Nephrops populations and the promotion of selective fishing gears."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Der jaehrliche Holzeinschlag in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland ist die zentrale Groesse zur Nutzung der Ressource Holz und damit eine wesentliche Kennzahl fuer die Beurteilung von Nachhaltigkeit und fuer die Abschaetzung ungenutzter Rohholzpotenziale. Zusaetzlich dient die Groesse der Ermittlung der Kohlenstoffspeicherung in Wald und Holz. Die amtliche Einschlagstatistik unterschaetzt den tatsaechlichen Einschlag erheblich. Ein durch das Thuenen-Institut in Zusammenarbeit mit der Universitaet Hamburg modifiziertes und weiterentwickeltes Verfahren zur verwendungsseitigen Abschaetzung der Holzeinschlaege ermoeglicht nun die Ermittlung realistischerer Jahresdaten fuer den Zeitraum von 1995 bis heute. Im Mittel werden durch die amtliche Einschlagsstatistik ueber den gesamten Betrachtungszeitraum nur etwa 81% des tatsaechlichen Einschlages erfasst. Das bedeutet, dass durchschnittlich jaehrlich ca. 13,0 Mio. m\u00b3 Holzeinschlag nicht erfasst wurden. Die Ergebnisse der verwendungsseitigen Rueckrechnung weichen im Durchschnitt (2003 - 2012) um etwa 1,9 Mio. Kubikmeter (Erntefestmeter ohne Rinde) bzw. um ca. 2,5 % von den Ergebnissen der dritten Bundeswaldinventur (BWI3 2014) ab. Allerdings zeigt sich, dass sich der Holzeinschlag nach der amtlichen Einschlagsstatistik in den letzten Jahren zeitweise dem berechneten Holzeinschlag naehert, aber aktuell nach wie vor deutlich niedriger liegt. Eine relevante Groesse fuer die verwendungsseitige Berechnung des Holzeinschlags sind die Bestandsveraenderungen der Rohholzlager im Wald. Leider liegen hierfuer keine direkten Angaben aus Statistik oder Literatur vor. Waldlagerdaten fuer die Jahre 2003-2015 koennen aus dem Testbetriebsnetz Forstwirtschaft (TBN-Forst) des Bundes abgeleitet werden. Als Grundlage fuer die Schaetzung fuer die Jahre ab 2016 dient die enge Korrelation der Waldlager mit den Industrielagern. Es ist moeglich, dass dieser Zusammenhang gerade in den vergangenen Schadjahren ab 2018 nicht zutrifft und im Wald deutlich andere Mengen eingelagert wurden. In der Literatur bzw. aktuellen Pressemeldungen finden sich jedoch keine Hinweise auf besonders hohe Einlagerungsaktivitaeten; moeglicherweise, weil ein groesserer Teil des Schadholzes nur bedingt fuer Einlagerung geeignet oder die Wirtschaftlichkeit nicht gegeben ist. Zwar wird von hohen Schadholzmengen berichtet, jedoch bedeutet dies nicht auch einen hohen Schadholzeinschlag. Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass grosse Schadholzmengen zeitweise nicht aufgearbeitet bzw. gefaellt wurden. Fuer die aktuelle Schaetzung der Lagerveraenderungen im Wald haben wir daher die Korrelation zum Industrielager, fuer das Daten in der amtlichen Statistik vorliegen, beibehalten. Eine hoehere Einlagerung wuerde sich in der verwendungsseitigen Einschlagsrueckrechnung direkt in einer Erhoehung des Holzeinschlags auswirken, eine niedrigere Einlagerung wuerde rechnerisch eine Verringerung des Holzeinschlags bewirken. Hinweis: Aufgrund neuer Eingangsgroessen in die Berechnungen sowie der Verwendung von Regressionsmodellen aendern sich in aller Regel auch die berechneten Werte der Vorjahre."

Zusaetzlich dient die Groesse der Ermittlung der Kohlenstoffspeicherung in Wald und Holz. Die amtliche Einschlagstatistik unterschaetzt den tatsaechlichen Einschlag erheblich. Ein durch das Thuenen-Institut in Zusammenarbeit mit der Universitaet Hamburg modifiziertes und weiterentwickeltes Verfahren zur verwendungsseitigen Abschaetzung der Holzeinschlaege ermoeglicht nun die Ermittlung realistischerer Jahresdaten fuer den Zeitraum von 1995 bis heute. Im Mittel werden durch die amtliche Einschlagsstatistik ueber den gesamten Betrachtungszeitraum nur etwa 80% des tatsaechlichen Einschlages erfasst. Das bedeutet, dass durchschnittlich jaehrlich ca. 13,6 Mio. m\u00b3 Holzeinschlag nicht erfasst wurden. Die Ergebnisse der verwendungsseitigen Rueckrechnung weichen im Durchschnitt (2003 - 2012) um etwa 1,9 Mio. Kubikmeter (Erntefestmeter ohne Rinde) bzw. um ca. 2,5 % von den Ergebnissen der dritten Bundeswaldinventur (BWI3 2014) ab. Allerdings zeigt sich, dass sich der Holzeinschlag nach der amtlichen Einschlagsstatistik in den letzten drei Jahren dem berechneten Holzeinschlag naehert, aber nach wie vor niedriger liegt. Eine relevante Groesse fuer die verwendungsseitige Berechnung des Holzeinschlags sind die Bestandsveraenderungen der Rohholzlager im Wald. Leider liegen hierfuer keine direkten Angaben aus Statistik oder Literatur vor. Waldlagerdaten fuer die Jahre 2003-2015 koennen aus dem Testbetriebsnetz Forstwirtschaft (TBN-Forst) des Bundes abgeleitet werden. Als Grundlage fuer die Schaetzung fuer die Jahre ab 2016 dient die enge Korrelation der Waldlager mit den Industrielagern. Es ist moeglich, dass dieser Zusammenhang gerade in den vergangenen Schadjahren ab 2018 nicht zutrifft und im Wald deutlich andere Mengen eingelagert wurden. In der Literatur bzw. aktuellen Pressemeldungen finden sich jedoch keine Hinweise auf besonders hohe Einlagerungsaktivitaeten; moeglicherweise, weil ein groesserer Teil des Schadholzes nur bedingt fuer Einlagerung geeignet oder die Wirtschaftlichkeit nicht gegeben ist. Zwar wird von hohen Schadholzmengen berichtet, jedoch bedeutet dies nicht auch einen hohen Schadholzeinschlag. Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass grosse Schadholzmengen nicht aufgearbeitet bzw. gefaellt wurden. Fuer die aktuelle Schaetzung der Lagerveraenderungen im Wald haben wir daher die Korrelation zum Industrielager, fuer das Daten in der amtlichen Statistik vorliegen, beibehalten. Eine hoehere Einlagerung wuerde sich in der verwendungsseitigen Einschlagsrueckrechnung direkt in einer Erhoehung des Holzeinschlags auswirken, eine niedrigere Einlagerung wuerde rechnerisch eine Verringerung des Holzeinschlags bewirken."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "As a toxic and harmful global pollutant, mercury (Hg) enters the marine environment through natural sources, and human activities. It bioaccumulates through the food chain and therefore, Hg is of great importance for environmental monitoring. This study aims to answer the question if Hg contamination in fish and sediment from the German Bight follows temporal trends. Therefore, 496 individual female dab (Limanda limanda) were analyzed. The Hg concentrations in the muscle of dab from the German Bight showed significant increase in function of time with an annual percental change of 1.4%, leading to a 41% increase in Hg contamination level within 25 years of monitoring. At the same time, Hg concentrations in sediment--analyzed in 86 samples--significantly decreased in the nearby North Sea environment. This surprising contradiction is shown in the present study and possible causes are discussed. It could be clearly shown that contamination in sediment and biota can follow completely different time courses and therefore, different environmental matrices should be considered in future monitoring studies. Age of the fish turned out to be a biological factor of particular importance for temporal trend analysis. Methode Mercury in fish The determination of Hg in fish from 1995 to 2009 followed the protocol described by Harms (1981, 1998). Briefly, wet samples were subjected to a pressure digestion by nitric acid in PTFE tubes heated up to 135 \u00b0C for 2 h. This was partly supported by a microwave system, 'MLS-Ethos-plus' (MLS Mikrowellen Labor-Systeme GmbH, Leutkirch, Germany). Mercury was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry using a flow injection mercury system Model 420 (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany) with background compensation and Hg lamp. A clean bench was used to avoid contamination during sample processing. The limit of detection (LD) was calculated according to DIN 32,645 (DIN, 1994) and was always below 1.2 \u03bcg Hg/kg wet weight (ww). The method used from 2010 to determine Hg in fish is in detail described in Kammann et al. (2021). Briefly, samples were freeze-dried using a lyophilizer (LD 1-2,Christ, Osterode, Germany) and subsequently homogenized using an agate mortar or an ultra Turrax tube drive dispenser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) to obtain a dry and homogenous sample powder. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, MLS, Leutkirch, Germany). A total of 20-30 mg of each sample were weighted into the boat containers of the DMA-80. Direct analysis for total Hg content was performed using a 10-level calibration with standards in 0.5 M nitric acid. The LD and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32,645 (DIN, 1994) with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, a LD of 0.080 \u03bcg/kg ww and a LQ of 0.230 \u03bcg/kg ww were determined for Hg. No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Preparation steps were carried out under clean benches all the time. Clean lab conditions of ISO class 7 were available since 2018. Nitric acid (69%, ultrapure quality) and certified standard solutions of Hg were purchased from Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 0.5 M nitric acid. Ultrapure water was obtained from a Purelab Flex 3 device (Elga Veolia; High Wycombe, UK). The accuracy of the Hg measurement in fish was determined by analysis of Certified Reference Materials (e.g., DORM-4) obtained from the National Research Council (NRC) in Canada which was taken through the same analytical procedure as the samples. All samples were measured in triplicates. External quality assurance was done by participation in laboratory proficiency tests conducted by QUASIMEME (www.wepal.nl) designed for marine environment analytics from 1997 to 2021. Results of 55 QUASIMEME intercalibrations are presented in Table S1 with a mean z-score of 0.09 and only 7% of unsatisfying results (z-score > = \u25022.5\u2502)."

However, access to small-scale data is often restricted due to data protection regulations. To address this limitation, the Agraratlas project was launched, aiming to create a comprehensive dataset at the community level, focusing on land use and livestock. Background and Objective German agricultural statistics on land use and livestock are crucial indicators for assessing environmental impacts. These statistics form the foundation for estimating trends and evaluating policy impacts within the Thuenen-Modellverbund. However, access to detailed data at the municipality level is restricted due to data security concerns. Additionally, changes in regional boundaries and updates to data collection classifications make it challenging to establish consistent comparisons over extended periods. The Agraratlas project aims to address these challenges by developing a coherent dataset at the community level, spanning from 1999 to the present. This will be achieved by integrating data from the Farm Structure Survey, agricultural statistics, and geo-referenced land use information, while adhering to strict data security requirements to make the dataset publicly available. The project's outcomes contribute to the Thuenen Institute's work on geo-referenced data infrastructure and will be published as part of this initiative. Approach The following steps are necessary to create a consistent, unrestricted dataset: Obtain permissions from the federal states to access community-level data. Analyze data at the Forschungsdatenzentrum (FDZ - Research Data Centre) using cluster analysis to comply with data security requirements. Integrate data through a Bayesian estimation procedure, combining: Public agricultural statistics Unconditional data generated by the cluster analysis Geo-referenced (GIS) land use data from the German Landscape Model (DLM) Validate results at the FDZ by comparing them with observed community data. Publish the dataset via the Thuenen geo-referenced data infrastructure (GDI). Develop a visualization tool at www.agraratlas.de to facilitate the analysis of land use and livestock densities. Data and Methods We employ geographic and geo-referenced methods, integrated with data preparation tools for model analysis, to address structural breaks and new classifications, close data gaps, and create a dataset that remains consistent across time and regions.

Darueber hinaus gab es immer wieder regionale Neuabgrenzungen und Neuklassifizierungen der pflanzlichen und tierischen Merkmale ueber die Zeit. Deshalb hat das Thuenen-Institut eine Schaetzmethode entwickelt und auf deren Basis einen flaechendeckenden Datensatz erarbeitet, der Trends zur Landnutzung und Tierhaltung in Deutschland bis auf Gemeindeebene abbilden kann. Dabei werden vorhandene Daten der oeffentlichen Agrarstatistik mit Daten einer Clusteranalyse und allgemeinen Landnutzungsdaten verbunden und in einem Schaetzverfahren auf einer Gemeinde/Kreis-Definition ueber die Zeit harmonisiert. Dieser Datensatz ist vollstaendig und konsistent ueber Merkmale, regionale Ebenen und Zeit auf Gemeindeebene, frei verfuegbar und haelt dabei den Datenschutz ein."

Small-scale dairies can only realize their economic potential of on-farm processing if they achieve consistently high cheese quality. However, experience shows that quality variation in goat milk occurs on farms during the lactation period, which may result in cheese defects, i.e., undesirable sensory deviations from their quality standard, if the on-farm-processing is not adapted to the milk quality. The aim of the project is therefore to examine the milk quality and to identify correlations to cheese-making characteristics and sensory quality of organic goat cheese. In addition, cheesemaking trials are conducted to develop and test technological measures (process parameters) to adapt to fluctuations in the milk quality. The collaborative partner VHM is responsible for the knowledge transfer measures. Data set description The data set contains 176 independent samples of raw organic goat's milk parameters obtained from three farms over three years. Goat breeds include German Improved Fawn and White, Thuringian Forest goats, or crossbred goats. Analyzed parameters are total bacterial count (TBC) and somatic cell count (SCC), content of fat, total protein, casein and calcium, pH, and titratable acidity. Raw milk samples were collected from bulk milk tanks in a regular sequence of 2 weeks within the lactation period (approx. from March to November). 356 independent observations are missing and a total of 10 observations were excluded from the data set. In some cases, logistical challenges and plannings necessitated a shift in the sampling interval. METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION Sample collection Raw milk samples were collected from bulk milk tanks at approx. 4 \u00b0C while milk was stirred. Approx. 125 mL of milk was sampled twice and analyses were performed in duplicate by a dairy laboratory accredited according to ISO 17025:2018. Milk samples were stored in insulated boxes, and equipped with special cool packs to ensure refrigerated transport below 8 \u00b0C for up to 24-48 hours. Samples were dispatched to the dairy laboratory by express delivery. Metrics about the date of collection, the date of analysis, and the shipping conditions are included in the data set. Analytical methods Total bacterial count (TBC) and somatic cell count (SCC) were determined by flow cytometry using BacSomatic (Foss, Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark). For interpretation of TBC and SCC, ASU L 01.01-7 / May 2022 and ASU L01.01-1/September 1998 were applied, respectively. Fat content was measured according to Gerber method, VDLUFA C 15.3.2 / 1985-01 and protein content was measured by Kjeldahl, VDLUFA C 30.2 / 1985-01. Casein content was calculated by applying VDLUFA C 30.4. Calcium was determined according to VDLUFA C10.6.8. Soxhlet-Henkel acidity (\u00b0SH) was obtained by titration according to VDLUFA Method 4.1.1. All methods are part of VDLUFA-Methodenbuch (2010), Vol. VI: Chemische, physikalische und mikrobiologische Untersuchungsverfahren fuer Milch, Milchprodukte und Molkereihilfsstoffe, VDLUFA-Verlag: Darmstadt, 7. edition. Information on the unit and a description of the parameters is provided in the variable list below. The accreditation of the laboratory refers to all the mentioned methods except for determination of pH and \u00b0SH. Data review Test results from the laboratory were used as primary data source. Upon receipt, the data was reviewed for plausibility. The results of each sample were subsequently verified by a second reviewer to ensure accuracy. Some results were excluded from the dataset; these exclusions are documented and further explained in a separate file and labelled 'NP' in case of 'not plausible' in the file, while missing data is labelled 'NA'. As the present work constitutes a data publication, no further analytical procedures were applied at this stage. Note on the interpretation of microbiological raw milk data The dataset contains occasional observations with very high bacterial counts, which should be regarded as exceptional events. These individual values are not representative of the overall hygienic status of the farms and do not allow for general conclusions regarding husbandry conditions. The data reflect farm-level snapshots of raw milk at the time of sampling and were not collected within the framework of official monitoring programs or for the assessment of regulatory compliance. Outlying values were retained in the dataset; in the affected farms, farm-specific corrective measures were subsequently implemented, which is reflected in reduced bacterial counts in follow-up measurements. RESTRICTION OF THE DATASET The dataset will remain restricted until the related scientific paper has been published."

We assessed CUE using the 18O-labelling method for soils from three European long-term liming field trials (i.e. Jyndevad, Versailles, and Duernast). Additionally, the immediate response of CUE to liming in the lab was tested accounting for lime-derived CO2 emission. The lime-induced pH shift was a strong determinant of CUE. However, the relationship between CUE and soil pH followed a U-shaped (i.e. quadratic) curve, suggesting that CUE may be lowest at near neutral soil pH and therefore to interfere with agronomic interests (i.e. high crop yield). To assess the potential contribution of CUE on the net liming effect on SOC stocks, we calculated OC inputs and SOC stocks. Liming had a positive effect on SOC stocks, regardless of the change in CUE. Our results suggest that CUE added to the net liming effect on SOC stocks. Statistical analyses and data visualisation were conducted in R v4.1.2 (2021-11-01) (R Core Team, 2020) using RStudio v2022.12.0 (Posit team, 2022).

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Grasslands provide a wide range of ecosystem services within agricultural landscapes. Mapping and assessing the status and use intensity of grasslands is thus important for environmental monitoring. We here provide maps with detected mowing events, as a proxy for grassland use intensity, for grassland areas across Germany for the year 2023. The dataset contains maps of grassland mowing activity in Germany, which have been produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire grassland area, i.e. permanent grassland, potentially permanent grassland (e.g. fodder crops) and other extensive areas. They are derived from dense time series of Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 (and 9) data. Map production is based on the methods described in Schwieder et al. (2022). The algorithm used to derive the maps is available as a user-defined function for the FORCE environment (Frantz, D., 2019). Each annual dataset includes seven layers: (1) the number of detected mowing events, (2) the day of year (DOY) of the first to sixth detected mowing event. Ancillary data layers are available on request. The maps include all areas that have at least once been classified as permanent grassland, cultivated grassland or fallow in the maps of agricultural land use between 2017 and 2023 that are provided by Thuenen Institute.The mowing events map therefore contains a substantial overestimation of grassland areas. Please consider to use the respective annual agricultural land use map or any other data source to generate a mask for your purpose. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the quality or completeness and exclude all liability. Please refer to Schwieder et al. (2022) for the related accuracy assessment and potential limitations and / or contact the authors directly. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the provided URL to the datasets (right click on the respective data set --> 'copy link address'). By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. References Frantz, D. (2019). FORCE--Landsat + Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data and Beyond. Remote Sensing, 11, 1124.

The map distinguishes eight classes (Larix, Picea, Pinus, Fagus, Quercus, other needleleaf, other broadleaf, and no trees) and is distributed as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) over a 100 km grid in EPSG:3035 (ETRS89 / LAEA Europe). The map was generated using a CatBoost model trained on forest plot inventories, citizen science observations, orthophoto interpretation, and LUCAS data, with additional features from DEM and climate datasets. Labels were filtered and aggregated to genus level to reduce noise. Early access notice This release is provided as an early access version. The map is still undergoing validation and fine-tuning, and a formal publication is planned. Updates and improvements may therefore be made in future releases. We welcome feedback and contributions of additional training data to further improve the map.

Whether viable hybrids are produced will most likely depend on the level of genomic divergence and associated genomic incompatibilities between the different entities as well as environmental conditions. By taking advantage of historical Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) otolith samples combined with genotyping and whole genome sequencing, we here investigate the genetic impact of the increased spawning stock biomass of the eastern Baltic cod stock in the mid 1980s. The eastern Baltic cod is genetically highly differentiated from the adjacent western Baltic cod, and locally adapted to the brackish environmental conditions in the deeper Eastern basins of the Baltic Sea unsuitable for its marine counterparts. Our genotyping results show an increased proportion of eastern Baltic cod in western Baltic areas (Mecklenburg Bay and Arkona Basin) - indicative of a range expansion westwards - during the peak population abundance in the 1980s. Additionally, we detect high frequencies of potential hybrids (including F1, F2 and backcrosses), verified by whole genome sequencing data for a subset of individuals. Analysis of mitochondrial genomes further indicates directional gene flow from eastern Baltic cod males to western Baltic cod females. Our findings unravel that increased overlap in distribution can promote hybridization between highly divergent populations, and that the hybrids can be viable and survive under specific and favourable environmental conditions. However, the observed hybridization had seemingly no long-lasting impact on the continuous separation and genetic differentiation between the unique Baltic cod stocks."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Ausdehnungen des Verbreitungsgebiets koennen zu einem verstaerkten Kontakt zwischen unterschiedlichen Populationen fuehren und damit das Potenzial fuer Hybridisierungsereignisse erhoehen. Ob lebensfaehige Hybriden entstehen, haengt hoechstwahrscheinlich vom Grad der genomischen Divergenz und den damit verbundenen genomischen Inkompatibilitaeten zwischen den verschiedenen Einheiten sowie von den Umweltbedingungen ab. Anhand historischer Otolithenproben des Ostseedorsches (Gadus morhua) in Kombination mit Genotypisierung und Ganzgenomsequenzierung untersuchen wir hier die genetischen Auswirkungen des Anstiegs der Biomasse des oestlichen Ostseedorsches als Laichfisch Mitte der 1980er Jahre. Der oestliche Ostseedorsch unterscheidet sich genetisch stark vom benachbarten westlichen Ostseedorsch und ist lokal an die brackigen Umweltbedingungen in den tieferen oestlichen Becken der Ostsee angepasst, die fuer seine marinen Gegenstuecke ungeeignet sind. Unsere Genotypisierungsergebnisse zeigen, dass der Anteil des oestlichen Ostseedorsches in den westlichen Ostseegebieten (Mecklenburger Bucht und Arkonabecken) waehrend des Hoehepunkts der Populationsdichte in den 1980er Jahren gestiegen ist, was auf eine Ausdehnung des Verbreitungsgebiets nach Westen hinweist. Ausserdem stellen wir eine hohe Haeufigkeit potenzieller Hybriden (einschliesslich F1, F2 und Rueckkreuzungen) fest, was durch Ganzgenomsequenzierungsdaten fuer eine Untergruppe von Individuen bestaetigt wird. Die Analyse der mitochondrialen Genome zeigt ausserdem, dass der Genfluss von maennlichen Dorschen der oestlichen Ostsee zu weiblichen Dorschen der westlichen Ostsee gerichtet ist. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass eine zunehmende Ueberlappung der Verbreitungsgebiete die Hybridisierung zwischen stark voneinander abweichenden Populationen foerdern kann und dass die Hybriden unter bestimmten, guenstigen Umweltbedingungen lebensfaehig sein und ueberleben koennen. Die beobachtete Hybridisierung hatte jedoch scheinbar keine dauerhaften Auswirkungen auf die kontinuierliche Trennung und genetische Differenzierung zwischen den einzelnen Dorschbestaenden der Ostsee."

Here, emphasis is put on the trueness-to-type of the genetic resources based on pomological and molecular characteristics. Over the years from 2009 to 2021, several projects were carried out to take an inventory of the germplasm collections in the apple (Malus \u00d7domestica) network of the German Fruit Genebank. In a first step, at least two knowledgeable experts of the German Pomological Association characterized accessions pomologically. In a second step, a DNA fingerprint analysis was used for the molecular characterization. The DNA fingerprint analysis utilized a set of 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 8 reference genotypes recommended by the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) Malus/Pyrus working group and was performed by Microsynth ecogenics GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). 8,184 samples (fruits/ leaves) of apple trees belonging to the German Fruit Genebank from eight network collections were investigated. 1,404 different fingerprints in correspondence to cultivars could be estimated for apple."

It provides a framework that numerically solves differential equations of SOC models based on first-order kinetics. Thus, SOC models can be simply defined and run to predict the temporal development of SOC. Beyond this, SORCERING determines the fluxes of SON and N mineralisation / immobilisation. Basic inputs are (1) the model parameters of a given SOC model expressed as the C transfer matrix (including information on decomposition and transfer rates between model pools), (2) the initial distributions of C and N among model pools and (3) time series of C and N inputs and rate modulating environmental factors. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is used to numerically solve the system of differential equations.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This dataset includes measurements of individual bee mortality, weight and behavior collected under laboratory conditions in six trials over two years. Individuals of seven different bee species were exposed to the plant protection product Karate(R) Zeon (containing the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin) at a field-realistic application rate of 0.075 L product/ha in a professional spray chamber. In addition, we applied either water as a control or dimethoate as a toxic reference to bee individuals of all species. In total, we tested 409 Apis mellifera, 385 Bombus terrestris, 383 Osmia bicornis, 139 Osmia cornuta, 140 Megachile rotundata, 105 Andrena vaga, and 103 Colletes cunicularius individuals. Bee individuals were placed into cages of 10 or 5 individuals depending on the species, and the mean individual weight of all non-Apis bees was measured as the total bee weight per cage devided by the number of bees in this cage. Bees were exposed and afterwards monitored over a period of 96 hours at pre-defined time intervals (2, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after application). At each time interval, we recorded their status (dead or alive) and behavioral abnormalities (moribund, cramps, apathy, affected [including restless, vertigo, uncoordinated and dorsal position]). Further methodological and analytical details are described in the associated paper by Juette et al.: Risk assessment requires several bee species to address species-specific sensitivity to insecticides at field-realistic concentrations. Scientific Reports, 2023. The dataset comprises four tables. Table 'Mortality' includes a row for each individual tested with lambda-cyhalothrin (716 individuals) or water (708 individuals) stating its species identity, the number of trial and cage it was placed in, the treatment it was exposed to, its status and at which time interval this status was observed. Table 'Dimethoate' includes a row for each individual tested with the toxic reference dimethoate (240 individuals) stating its species identity, the number of trial and cage it was placed in, its status and at which time interval this status was observed. Table 'Behavior' includes a row for each cage that contained bee individuals treated with lambda-cyhalothrin (126 cages) or water (125 cages) at each time interval. This table states the species identity, the number of trial and cage, the treatment, the time interval, and the number of bee individuals in this cage at this time, which were dead, were alive, showed moribund behavior, showed apathy, showed cramps or showed an affected behavior, which could be any of four abnormal behaviors (restlessness, vertigo, dorsal position, uncoordinated movement). Table 'Weight' includes a row for each cage that contained bee individuals treated with lambda-cyhalothrin (126 cages) or water (125 cages) at each time interval. This table states the species identity, the number of trial and cage, the treatment, the number of bee individuals in this cage, and the mean weight of a bee individual in this cage."

In the datasheet Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR(2) the heubach value for seed lot 2 in g/100kg had to be corrected for lab E (see in the datasheet: test 3; column F, line 9) correct is 0,205 (former value: 0,021). With the Heubach method free floating dust of treated seeds can be measured. The Heubach value is used as an indicator for seed quality. One way to make the heubach results more reliable can be the definition of LOD and LOQ. Blank measurements were conducted in several heubach labs for this data collection to allow a calculation of LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for the Heubach method. Three Tests (Data_LOD_LOQ_ZR.xlsx) were performed following the EU-Code of Practise for the monitoring of floating dust of treated seeds (Version 05.1, published by the Seed Treatment Stewardship Steering Committee (STICCS Group) on 1st August 2021). The material and methods used are described in Material_and_Method.pdf and the procedure for estimation of LOD and LOQ for Heubach seed abrasion dust method is described in Procedure_for_the_estimation_of_LOD_and_LOQ_sugar_beets.pdf."

To achieve this, standardised tools need to be developed, validated and kept up-to-date with recent developments of food products and nutritional behaviour of the population. Recently, the human intestinal microbiome has been identified as an essential mediator between nutrition and host health. Despite growing interest in this connection, only few associations between microbiome, nutrition and health have been clearly established. Available studies paint an inconsistent picture, partly due to a lack of standardisation. Objective: The ErNst Study (\u201aErfassung der Energie- und Naehrstoffzufuhr', engl. \u201aassessment of energy and nutrient intake') addresses two objectives. Firstly, to verify if food consumption as well as energy and nutrient intake of the German population can be recorded validly by means of the dietary recall software GloboDiet, which will be applied in the German National Nutrition Monitoring. And secondly, to obtain high quality data using standardised methods on the microbiome, combined with dietary intake data and additional faecal sample material to also assess the functional activity of the microbiome by measuring microbial metabolites. Methods: Healthy female and male participants aged between 18 and 79 years were recruited. Anthropometric measurements included body height and weight, body mass index and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). For the purpose of validation of the GloboDiet software, current food consumption was assessed with a 24-h recall. Nitrogen and potassium concentrations were measured from 24-h urine collections to enable comparison with the intake of protein and potassium estimated by the GloboDiet software. Physical activity was measured over a period of at least 24 h using a wearable accelerometer to validate the estimated energy intake. Stool samples were collected in duplicate for a single timepoint and used for DNA isolation and subsequent amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine microbiome composition. For the identification of associations between nutrition and microbiome, the habitual diet was determined using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) covering a period of 30 days. Results: In total, 117 participants met the inclusion criteria. The study population was equally distributed between the sexes and three age groups (18 - 39, 40 - 59, 60 - 79 years). Stool samples accompanying habitual diet data (30-d FFQ) are available for 106 participants. Current diet data and 24-h urine samples for the validation of GloboDiet are available for 109 participants, of which 82 cases also include physical activity data. Conclusions: We completed recruitment and sample collection of the ErNst study with a high degree of standardisation. Samples and data will be used to validate the GloboDiet software for the German National Nutrition Monitoring and to compare microbiome composition and nutritional patterns."

Mapping and assessing the status and use intensity of grasslands is thus important for environmental monitoring. We here provide maps with detected mowing events, as a proxy for grassland use intensity, for grassland areas across Germany for the year 2023. The dataset contains maps of grassland mowing activity in Germany, which have been produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire grassland area, i.e. permanent grassland, potentially permanent grassland (e.g. fodder crops) and other extensive areas. They are derived from dense time series of Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 (and 9) data. Map production is based on the methods described in Schwieder et al. (2022). The algorithm used to derive the maps is available as a user-defined function for the FORCE environment (Frantz, D., 2019). Each annual dataset includes seven layers: (1) the number of detected mowing events, (2) the day of year (DOY) of the first to sixth detected mowing event. Ancillary data layers are available on request. The maps include all areas that have at least once been classified as permanent grassland, cultivated grassland or fallow in the maps of agricultural land use between 2017 and 2023 that are provided by Thuenen Institute.The mowing events map therefore contains a substantial overestimation of grassland areas. Please consider to use the respective annual agricultural land use map or any other data source to generate a mask for your purpose. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the quality or completeness and exclude all liability. Please refer to Schwieder et al. (2022) for the related accuracy assessment and potential limitations and / or contact the authors directly. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the provided URL to the datasets (right click on the respective data set --> 'copy link address'). By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. References Frantz, D. (2019). FORCE--Landsat + Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data and Beyond. Remote Sensing, 11, 1124.

The video demonstrates a first methodical approach to estimating and calculating the maximum possible dermal exposure with the drag hose application technique and the worst case scenario over the cow on an life like cow dummy. In the investigated scenario, the life like cow dummy is placed in the direction of travel of the application unit. The drag hoses run over the life like cow dummy. Using the number of nozzles and the duration of their contact with the life like cow dummy, the maximum amount of liquid that could be applied using the nozzles' specified application rates (three times AirMix 110-25; twice AirMix 110-04 OC) was computed. The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in the testing facility at Kiel University's Institute of Agricultural Engineering, where the drag hose system was installed."

The data provide an overview of the study of dermal exposure measurements on a life like cow dummy using the collector Tyvek and the fluorescent dye pyranine. Depending on the worst-case scenario, the cow was covered in regions where exposure is expected. Three different worst-case scenarios (over the cow, passing the cow, and 0 m frontal) were considered, together with two different application techniques (drag hose system and robot dummy). Exposure measurements were taken in a cattle barn under real-life conditions twice in 2022 (in May and August). In May, each scenario was carried out seven times, and five times in August."

Evaluation of tolerant/resistant genotypes was previously based on inoculation with virus-bearing leafhoppers and subsequent phenotyping in gauze houses under semi-field conditions. Within an improved procedure, plants are inoculated in the greenhouse under an infection hood and subsequently planted out in gauze houses. To compare the two methods, temperature profiles were established for both variants (2- Temperature profile) and the optimal inoculation time for inoculation under an infection hood in the greenhouse was determined (3-Inoculation time). In addition, a test panel of 80 genotypes (1-plant material) was phenotyped for both variants for germination rate (4-Germination rate), infection status, symptom score and relative virus titer (5- Gauze house, 6-Inoculation hood). The methods used to generate the data are described within Pfrieme, A.K. et al.: Comparison of two different experimental environments for resistance screenings for leafhopper-transmitted wheat dwarf virus in wheat.

PD contain less fiber and are often devoid of soluble fiber, which can impact gut health. Thus, the aim of the present study was to modify the PD AIN93G by addition of soluble fiber, to promote more natural gut development as seen with chow diets. Methods: One hundred twenty male C57BL/6J mice (from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were randomly assigned to one of five feeding groups, immediately after arrival (24 mice/group, 8 cages/group with 3 mice/cage). They were fed either a chow diet, AIN93G or one of three modified AIN93G with increased fiber content and different ratios of soluble fiber to cellulose for 12 weeks (70% soluble fiber: 30% cellulose [70S], 50% soluble fiber: 50% cellulose [50S] or 30% soluble fiber: 70% cellulose [30S]). As soluble fibers a mixture of inulin and pectin (50:50) was used. During the 12 weeks of intervention, body weight and food intake was assessed four times a week, and feces was collected during week 0, week 5 and week 10. After the intervention gut tissue was collected for histology (HE and AB stains) and gene expression analysis (qPCR). Furthermore, gut content was collected for analysis of microbiota (16s sequencing) and short-chain fatty acids (GC-FID)."

The aim of the systematic analysis is to identify patterns in drivers of forest area development. The systematic analysis was conducted using the RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses in environmental research (ROSES) method. This approach involves the search for literature in two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) using a clearly defined search string and the screening for literature based on a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria within the author team. A comprehensive protocol and method description can be found in the evidence and gap map published by Tandetzki et. al. (2022)[1]. The method introduced in Tandetzki et al. (2022) is utilized and updated, including the search for articles which was renewed and now includes publications up to August 2022. After screening the articles, a well-defined study selection was made following a pre-defined and standardized process. In this process, a distinction is made between basic studies, which take into account only a few basic drivers of forest area development, and advanced studies, which assess the significant influence of multiple drivers on forest area development. Finally, the selection includes 85 studies, out of which 14 are considered as basic studies. In the dataset presented here, all included studies, their extracted data (e.g., datasets, data source, estimation methods, and studies periods), the study design, as well as the drivers of forest area development in form of independent variables (the latter are coded with numbers indicating the type of influence on the significance level).

In spices and other types of powdered food products, E 551 is mainly used as a separating agent or anti-caking agent. Silicon dioxide as a food additive is under public discussion due to controversial views on the declaration obligation of the substance as an engineered nanomaterial. According to the Food Information Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011, all food ingredients that are present in a food in the form of engineered nanomaterials must be clearly listed in the list of ingredients. The name of such ingredients must be followed by the word 'nano' in brackets. So far, this spice mixture is one of only very few food products on the market with nano-labelled E 551. The food additive is an industrially manufactured material, consisting of amorphous agglomerated and aggregated granules whose particle sizes are mainly in the microscale size range. This dataset contains SEM images showing the morphology of SiO2 aggregates in a commercially available instant meal product containing E 551. In the high magnification images (50.000x - 100.000x) the outline of individual constituent nanoparticles was only partly visible. Basic information about the SEM setup and the sample preparation can be found in the attached txt-file. All in all, the obtained SEM results show, that E551 in this product is present in aggregated form and is deposited on the other food components, fulfilling its purpose as anti-caking agent. Besides SiO2 aggregates also (unwanted) other solid food matrix components were present in the prepared samples. Therefore, qualitative elemental analysis was carried out by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on the food samples in parallel to SEM imaging. Via EDX-mapping, showing the spatial distribution of the target elements (Si and O), the SiO2 particles/aggregates could easily be identified. Corresponding EDX element analysis data for this product (representative example) can be found in the data folder 'Spice_mixture_EDX_element_mapping'."

It is mainly used in powdered foods as a separating agent or anti-caking agent. Furthermore, it can be used as filler and as carrier for emulsifiers, colourings and flavourings. Silicon dioxide as a food additive is under public discussion due to controversial views on the declaration obligation of the substance as an engineered nanomaterial. According to the Food Information Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011, all food ingredients that are present in a food in the form of engineered nanomaterials must be clearly listed in the list of ingredients. The name of such ingredients must be followed by the word 'nano' in brackets. So far, there are only very few E 551-containing foods on the market with nano-labelling of E 551. The SiO2 used for this purpose is an industrially manufactured product in powdered form. It consists of amorphous agglomerated and aggregated granules whose particle sizes are mainly in the microscale size range. However, these aggregates consist of nanoscaled constituent particles (also called 'primary particles'). This dataset contains SEM images showing the morphology of SiO2 aggregates in the pristine food additive called 'Sipernat(R)22S'. In the high magnification images (50.000x - 300.000x) the constituent nanoparticles can be visualised. Basic information about the SEM setup and the sample preparation can be found in the attached txt-file. All in all, the obtained SEM results show, that the primary particles size of SiO2 particles within the aggregates are in the size range of ca. 15 - 30 nm."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Environmental heterogeneity is an important driver of ecological communities. Here, we assessed the effects of local and landscape spatial environmental heterogeneity on ant community structure in temperate semi-natural upland grasslands of Central Germany. We surveyed 33 grassland sites representing a gradient in elevation and landscape composition. Local environmental heterogeneity was measured in terms of variability of temperature and moisture within and between grassland sites. Grassland management type (pasture vs. meadows) was additionally included as a local environmental heterogeneity measure. The complexity of habitat types in the surroundings of grassland sites was used as a measure of landscape environmental heterogeneity. As descriptors of ant community structure, we considered species composition, community evenness, and functional response traits. We found that extensively grazed pastures and within-site heterogeneity in soil moisture at local scale, and a high diversity of land cover types at the landscape scale affected ant species composition by promoting nest densities. Ant community evenness was high in wetter grasslands with low within-site variability in soil moisture and surrounded by a less diverse landscape. Fourth-corner models revealed that ant community structure response to environmental heterogeneity was mediated mainly by worker size, colony size, and life history traits related with colony reproduction and foundation. We discuss how withinsite local variability in soil moisture and low-intensity grazing promote ant species densities, and highlight the role of habitat temperature and humidity in affecting community evenness. We hypothesize that a higher diversity of land cover types in a forest-dominated landscape buffers less favorable environmental conditions for ant species establishment and dispersal between grasslands. We conclude that spatial environmental heterogeneity at local and landscape scales plays an important role as a deterministic force in filtering ant species and, along with neutral processes (e.g. stochastic colonization), in shaping ant community structure in temperate semi-natural upland grasslands."

Participatory mapping was used to produce maps at the landscape level from the perspective of individuals. Mapping was carried out in workshops assembling representatives from the research landscapes. Polygons were delineated in focus group discussions on print outs of satellite images of approximately 80*120 cm. All mapped information was digitized by project staff after the workshops. Polygons of single governance arrangements have been delineated; governance arrangements were defined as spatial units with a homogeneous constellation of governance components. Subsequently governance quality as well as property rights were scored in focus group discussions for selected polygons by the participants. Governance assessments based on the World Ressource Institute's method 'Assessing Forest Governance: The Governance of Forests Initiative Indicator Framework' (Davis et al 2013). Mean governance quality is calculated per polygon as the arithmetic mean of single governance elements including participation, law enforcement, institutions, forest management practices and tenure. Property rights based on Ostrom (1999). Mean property rights as arithmetic mean per polygon of single rights including access, use rights, administration, alienation and exclusion. For project information see www.la-foret.org. Different methdological components were combined to obtain the data set, including participatory mapping, focus group discussions, governance assessments following the methodology of the World Resource Institute (Davis et al. 2013). For each component field methodologies were designed as a basis to train field teams in all three countries. Training of the field teams, pilot surveys, intercalibration exercises and participation of the teamleaders and country coordinators helped to harmonize assessments accross landscapes and countries. Single governance elements such as institutions, law enforcement, participation, forest management and tenure were each assessed by three elements of quality, i.e. specified by operational indicators. Data was digitized by field teams in a time near manner to enable checks in the field in unclear cases. Polygons and delineations in the data are the product of research activities that capture the perceptions of different user groups. They do not reflect or claim to define political borders."

To date, little evidence of WDV-resistant/tolerant cultivars has been published, and no information is available for associated markers and QTL to WDV in barley. Therefore, identification of genetic factors controlling WDV to reduce the negative impact of WDV on yield plays an important role in resistance breeding. In this study, we examined a set of 480 barley genotypes to identify genotypic differences in response to WDV. Five traits, including infection rate (ELISA 60), total grain weight, plant height, number of ears per plant and thousand grain weight, were measured under infected and uninfected conditions. Finally, phenotypic and genotypic data of 191 out of 480 genotypes were used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A set of 34, 408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified on the 50 K iSelect array. In total, 1, 3, 2, 2, and 1 significantly associated markers on chromosomes 3H, 4H, 5H, and 7H were identified for ELISA-60, relative performance of total grain weight, plant height, number of ears per plant, and thousand grain weight (on chromosome 7H), respectively."

Three regions were selected to capture the different FT phases within each country, totalling up to nine regions. Within each of the nine regions, four landscapes of approximately 100-150km2 each were selected, thus resulting in 36 landscapes. Each of the 36 landscapes is located within adistinct country-specific administration unit (i.e., chiefdoms, parroquias, and municipalities in Zambia, Ecuador, and the Philippines, respectively), selected to ensure homogenous formal administration across landscapes. The landscapes represent their respective regions' typical land-use, socioeconomic, demographic, and biophysical attributes. For project information see www.la-foret.org."

Participatory mapping was used to produce maps at the landscape level from the perspective of individuals. Mapping was carried out in workshops assembling representatives from the research landscapes. Polygons were delineated in focus group discussions on print outs of satellite images derived from Google Earth or Bing of approximately 80*120 cm. All mapped information was digitized by project staff after the workshops. Classification into land use categories was based on a project specific and four-tiered land cover and land use classification scheme. For project information see www.la-foret.org."

The surveys were conducted in 2017/18 in the Pilippines, in 2017 in Ecuador and in 2018/19 in Zambia. Results of approx 100 households for each of the landscapes are aggregated per landscape as provision of results for single households would violate privacy rights. However, the location of the underlying households is given in the 'Households' layer. Visualization of single households in the highest zoom mode is switched off, also in order to protect the privacy of the households. For project information see www.la-foret.org."

It consists of two chambers separated by a 10 \u03bcM microporous membrane. Untreated semen is applied in one chamber, sperm collection medium in the other. Motile sperm cells are selected by actively swimming through the membrane pores into the medium containing chamber. After 30 min incubation, the sperm collection medium can be aspirated and the purified sperm is ready for further use. In a first experiment we assessed sperm quality and recovery of frozen-thawed semen from six different bulls (n = 6) prior to and after purification with the VetCountTM Harvester or BoviPureTM gradient centrifugation, a commercial available standard technique. In a second approach, a competitive fertilization assay was performed. Ten straws per bull were pooled, split in two subsamples, and simultaneously purified either with the VetCountTM Harvester or BoviPureTM gradient centrifugation. Following purification, sperm cells from each treatment group were fluorescently labeled with either MitoTrackerTM Red FM or MitoTrackerTM Green FM. In vitro matured oocytes were inseminated with equal numbers of red and green labeled sperm. Eighteen hours after fertilization, fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the origin of the fertilizing spermatozoon."

The participants, ranging from German federal research institutes, federal state laboratories to universities and companies, were asked to follow their routine in-house protocols for sequencing. Participants prepared and sequenced 10 isolates and one previously isolated DNA (control) per species, applying a broad range of library preparation kits. Sequencing platforms included Illumina's MiSeq, NextSeq, iSeq, NovaSeq and Thermo Fisher Scientific's Ion S5. Sequence and assembly quality was then analyzed centrally for individual samples. Additionally, SNP and cgMLST calling were performed to assess the reproducibility of sequence data for individual samples."

Die Themen umfassen zum Beispiel die persoenliche Perspektive auf das Thema Ernaehrung im Allgemeinen, die Ausgestaltung der derzeitigen Ernaehrungsweise, den Austausch zu Ernaehrungsthemen im sozialen Umfeld und die Wissens- und Informationsbeschaffung rund um Ernaehrung. Die Interviews sind durch den Leitfaden mit leitenden Hauptfragestellungen thematisch gerahmt. Den Befragten wird aber Raum gelassen, um ueber Themen in Verbindung mit Ernaehrung zu sprechen, die Ihnen wichtig sind. Der Fragebogen ist in drei Spalten aufgeteilt. Die Hauptleitfragen in der ersten Spalte werden immer gestellt. In der zweiten Spalte befindet sich eine Checkliste mit Themen, die besprochen werden sollen und in der dritten Spalte befinden sich Fragen zur Hilfestellung, die zusaetzlich und unterstuetzend gestellt werden koennen, um die gewuenschten Informationen zu erhalten. Der Leitfaden ist auf eine ca. 90-minuetige Interviewdauer ausgelegt, wobei den Teilnehmenden stets die erforderliche Zeit zum Nachdenken und fuer ausfuehrlichere Schilderungen gewaehrt wird, sodass die Interviewdauer variieren kann."

In this publication we provide a data set with crop yield and area for Germany from 1979 to 2021. The data are spatially resolved to 397 districts with an average size of 900 km2 and include the crops summer barley, winter barley, grain maize, silage maize, oats, potatoes, winter rape, rye, sugarbeet, triticale and winter wheat. The crop yield data covers on average about 9.5 million ha per year and 80% of Germany's total arable land. The data set contains 211,292 data points. It was obtained by collecting and digitizing crop data from 14 German statistical offices and harmonising it across regions and time."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) is an important fruit crop that is widely cultivated within the northern hemisphere. Its fruits are rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds that have been linked to numerous health benefits, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. The demand for sour cherry has been increasing due to its use in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Breeding of sour cherry has been a major focus of research and development in recent years, aiming to improve yield, fruit quality, and disease resistance. One of the main challenges in sour cherry breeding is the genetic complexity of the species, which makes it difficult to identify and select desirable traits. However, advances in molecular biology and genomics have provided new tools and resources for sour cherry breeders, enabling them to identify and characterize important genes and markers associated with desirable traits. Rapid progress in third-generation sequencing technologies enables breeders to explore and exploit the genomic information underlying economical important traits. We used Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION platform and R9.4.1 pore type and Illumina NovaSeqTM to sequence the genome of tetraploid sour cherry (Prunus cerasus). The genome and annotation visualization is permanently hosted at an assembly hub http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/private-hubs/pcer/hub.txt. The data on this platform includes 28 files, supporting the assembling, annotation procedure, and additional data used to characterize the segmental allopolyploid structure of the genome. As a result, a genome sequence has been processed (20_WGS_PCE_2_0.fa). The final genome sequence was annotated using Braker 1 and Braker 2 and the GeMoMa pipeline and 14 reference datasets from other Prunus species (Prunus_cerasus_families_fa.gz, genome_chr_fa_masked.gz, rm1_genome_chr_fa_out.gz, rm1_genome_chr_fa_tbl.gz, rm2_genome_chr_fa_out.gz, rm2_genome_chr_fa_tbl.gz, tsebra_braker1_2_gmst_v4_aa.gz, tsebra_braker1_2_gmst_v4_codingseq.gz, tsebra_braker1_2_gmst_v4-gtf.gz, final_annotation_1.gff). The final structural annotation and protein predictions are provided for future studies (final_annotation_proteins.fasta). The functional prediction was performed with InterProScan (Results IPS_PCE_A.xlsx, Results IPS_PCE_F.xlsx). In addition, the sequences and annotation of the chloroplast (PCE_chloroplast_1_0.fa, GeSeqJob_20220901_192228_PCE_chloroplast_GFF3.gff3) and mitochondrion (PCE_mitochondria_1_0.fa, GeSeqJob_20230103_105327_PCE_mitochondria_GFF3.gff3) are presented. Moreover, we used percentage of base coverage from rna-seq reads (RNAseq_avium.tsv, RNAseq_fruticosa.tsv), genomic reads (percentages_125.tsv) and % IAA (best_iAA_all_transcripts_PA_PF_only.xlsx, suppl_data_TabS5.csv) to evaluate the structure of the genome sequence on the occurrence of homoeologous exchanges. We also determined the position of molecular markers (suppl_data_FigS5.xlsx) and LTRs (From_PCE_Prunus_avium_fna_mod_pass.list, From_PCE_Prunus_fruticosa_fna_mod_pass.list) on both subgenomes. Furthermore, the position of LTRs was determined on the genomes of P. avium (Prunus_avium_NCBI_fna_mod_pass.list) and P. fruticosa (Prunus_fruticosa_NCBI_fna_mod_pass.list)."

Using the example of pesticide applications in rose crops, we show that the analysis of active ingredient deposits in horticultural practice is also an essential component for assessing the sensitivity of the pests. We document here the origin of the leaves used for the bioassays and describe in detail the application of the pesticides to the leaf discs using the Potter tower. The individual analysis results of the active ingredient quantities that were applied to the leaf discs in the laboratory and to the insides of the roller rim glasses in the laboratory and that remained attached to rose leaves in horticultural practice are attached."

In past seasons regional massing of wild bird cases were seen at the German coasts of the Baltic and North Sea, but species mainly affected varied from season to season.

Moreover, a script for usage in R is added (.txt) Using measurement data from the EmiDaT project [1], digital twins of three naturally ventilated cattle barns (barn I, barn II, barn III) were developed and validated. Barn I featured a slatted floor with a manure pit underneath, barn II had a slatted floor with external manure storage, and barn III had a solid floor with manure also stored externally. The boundary conditions used for the simulations can be found on the first sheet of the respective Excel files, and the results of the validation simulations are on the second sheet. After successful validation, simulations were carried out for events that were not covered by the measurement periods of the EmiDaT data. For this purpose, weather data from nearby measurement stations operated by the German Weather Service were evaluated. The boundary conditions for these simulations are provided on the third sheet of the Excel file, and the corresponding results are on the fourth sheet. The statistical evaluation can be reproduced by using the R-script. Solution data and simulation plots are given to allow for transparency and reproductivity of the results. This approach demonstrated that simulations can extend the data basis beyond the available measurement data. This can lead to improved estimates of annual emission behavior and better extrapolation of emission factors. References 1. KTBL.

Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial \u03b1-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids. The effects on hepatic lipid metabolism might thus at least partially be mediated by microbiota-dependent mechanisms."

The experiment was carried out in summer 2020 with 79 fattening pigs. Data loggers were used to record the climate data temperature and relative humidity. This data were used to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI). It was found that there were sometimes considerable discrepancies between the measured and calculated water consumption. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be the age of the existing water requirement equations, as there has been a clear breeding development in the last decades and thus a strong increase in pig performance. Based on the deviations, six new water consumption equations were established, which consider the parameters body weight (BW), temperature, THI and feed consumption. Factually, THI and body weight should be included in the equation as predictor variables, and the evaluation also shows good results, so the use of this equation in practice should be considered. Overall, it became apparent that there is still a need for further research to make the water consumption equations more precise. This would require a larger data base."

Zwischen den gemessenen und den kalkulierten Wasserverbraeuchen konnten teilweise deutliche Unterschiede ermittelt werden. Einer der Gruende fuer die starken Abweichungen kann darin liegen, dass die Formeln zur Kalkulation des Wasserverbrauchs der Mastschweine bereits aelter sind. In den letzten Jahrzehnten gab es eine deutliche zuechterische Weiterentwicklung mit der eine erhebliche Leistungssteigerung bei den Mastschweinen erzielt wurde. Daher wurden sechs neue Wasserbedarfsformeln mit den Parametern Lebendgewicht, Temperatur, THI und Futterverbrauch abgeleitet. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die Praediktorvariablen THI und Lebendmasse gute Ergebnisse erzielten, sodass diese Formeln fuer die Praxis als geeignet erscheinen. Insgesamt besteht aber noch weiterer Forschungsbedarf, um die Gleichungen zu praezisieren. Dafuer waere aber eine groessere Datengrundlage erforderlich."

Hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of the pathological prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain. Classical BSE (C-type) and two atypical BSE forms (L- and H-type) are known, and can be discriminated by biochemical characteristics. The data presented here underline that immunohistochemistry can also be used to identify type-specific PrPSc profiles which can be used for discriminatory purposes. For this brain samples from 21 cattle, intracerebrally inoculated with C-, H-, and L-type BSE, were used as well as three orally C-type BSE infected animals. Using six brain regions distinct lesion (H&E staining) and PrPSc profiles were determined. While the neuroanatomical distribution of lesions and the PrPSc accumulation were highly consistent between the groups, the topographic and cellular PrPSc profile revealed characteristic pattern for the different BSE types."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The German Fruit Genebank (https://www.deutsche-genbank-obst.de/) is a decentralized network dedicated to coordinating various germplasm collections across Germany. The aim is to conserve and utilize the genetic resources of native fruit species, i.e. pear. For effective conservation, the investigation of authenticity of the genetic resources is essential. Between 2019 and 2023, two projects were performed on the pear collections of the German Fruit Genebank to characterize the cultivars pomologically and molecularly. Eight partners of the pear network of the German Fruit Genebank participated in the projects. First, at least two experts of the Fruit Orchard Agency Schlaraffenburg (Schlaraffenburger gGmbH, https://schlaraffenburger.de/) identify the pear cultivars pomologically and define the authentic cultivar name per tree and accession. Second, 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and seven reference genotypes in recommendation of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) Malus/Pyrus working group were used for genetic fingerprinting. The molecular analysis, including experimental work and statistical analysis for grouping the genetic profiles based on similarity, was performed by Microsynth ecogenics GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). The pomological and molecular data was compiled and resulted in 1,945 complete samples. The most important data features per sample are the cultivar name, the authenticity expressed by the trueness-to-type criterion, the molecular group and the genetic profile. Lastly, the individual samples were collated into unique, synthetic genetic profiles per distinguished pear cultivars with the help of a computer program and manual review. Mutations and sports of cultivars cannot be distinguished molecularly, but only pomologically and are grouped within the origin cultivar as they carry the same molecular group but different cultivar names. In total, 421 pear cultivars with corresponding genetic fingerprints were identified and evaluated for their authenticity as part of the German Fruit Genebank as presented in the published dataset. Additionally, the genetic fingerprints were aligned to international datasets to assign the Pyrus UNiQue genotype code (PUNQ). To evaluate the certainty of the synthetic genetic profiles, a quality ratio was calculated per genetic locus and on average where the consensus across samples is reflected."

For more details please see the associated article Reiser et al (2023) in Aquatic Living Resources. The following parameters were recorded: (1) number of incubated eggs, (2) egg survival, (3) hatch success, (4) length-at-age, (5) larval mortality, and (6) larval prey consumption. Data on all six parameters are provided as separate CSV files. In addition, a legend of the abbreviations used in the CSV files is provided.

Das auf Sentinel-2-Satellitendaten basierende Waldschadenerfassungssystem ermoeglicht differenzierte Veraenderungs- und Schadanalysen fuer die vier Untersuchungsgebiete des Projektes, die in Sachsen, Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Wuerttemberg liegen. In dem vorliegenden Datensatz sind die jaehrlichen Waldschaeden, die jeweils im Zeitraum vom 01.09. bis 31.08. erkannt wurden, als Jahresprodukte von 2018 bis 2022 zusammengestellt. Der Stichtag der Produkte ist jeweils der 31.08.. Die Genauigkeit der Jahresprodukte wurde nach Stehman (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207) auf Basis stichprobenbasierter Validierungen berechnet. Dabei erreichen die Produkte eine Gesamtgenauigkeit im Bereich von \u2265 95%. Die Jahresprodukte wurden nur fuer bestockte Waldflaechen, d.h. innerhalb der bestockten Holzbodenflaeche (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221205151218) berechnet. Im Anschluss wurden die Ergebnisse mit der deutschlandweiten Baumartenkarte (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221214084846) verschnitten. Fuer jede Schadflaeche wird der Stichtag, die Flaeche in Hektar und die dominierende Baumart nach Blickensdoerfer (2023) angegeben. Die Jahresprodukte als Ergebnisse des Projektes FNEWs bieten umfassende Anwendungsmoeglichkeiten fuer Forstwirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Politik. Die Einordnung der Schaeden wird als Basis fuer die forstliche Planung, politische Massnahmen und die Modellierung weiterer Faktoren genutzt. Auf Basis der Jahresprodukte wurde darueber hinaus eine oekonomische Bewertung der Waldschaeden im Projekt durchgefuehrt.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "In the project Remote Sensing Based National Forest Damage Assessment System (FNEWS), forest damage is assessed on the basis of a structural time series model in combination with the Kalman filter. The forest damage monitoring system based on Sentinel-2 satellite data enables change and damage analyses for the four study areas of the project, which are located in Saxony, Lower Saxony, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the presented data set, the annual forest damage detected in each case in the period from 01.09. to 31.08. is provided as annual products from 2018 to 2022. The reference date of the products is 31.08. for each product. The accuracy of the annual products was calculated according to Stehman (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207) on the basis of sample-based validations. The products achieve an overall accuracy in the range of \u2265 95%. Annual products were calculated only for stocked forest areas, i.e. within the stocked forest area (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221205151218). Finally, the results were intersected with the Germany-wide dominant tree species map (2023, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221214084846). Each damaged area is given the reference date, the area in hectares and the dominant tree species according to Blickensdoerfer (2023). The annual products as results of FNEWS offer substantial application potential for forestry, science and politics. The classification of damage is used as a basis for forest planning, political measures and the modelling of further factors. On the basis of the annual products, an economic evaluation of forest damage was also carried out within the project.

Here, emphasis is put on the trueness-to-type of the genetic resources based on pomological and molecular characteristics. Over the years from 2009 to 2025, several projects were carried out to take an inventory of the germplasm collections in the apple (Malus \u00d7domestica) network of the German Fruit Genebank. In a first step, at least two knowledgeable experts of the German Pomological Association characterized accessions pomologically. In a second step, a DNA fingerprint analysis was used for the molecular characterization. The DNA fingerprint analysis utilized a set of 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 8 reference genotypes recommended by the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) Malus/Pyrus working group and was performed by Microsynth ecogenics GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). 9,162 samples (fruits/ leaves) of apple trees belonging to the German Fruit Genebank from eight network collections were investigated. 1,565 different (synthetic) genetic fingerprints in correspondence to cultivars could be estimated for apple. The updated version integrates the additional molecular characterization data of project 2824BE001."

Especially, Norway spruce stands increasingly suffer under drought. Here, we analysed the transcriptional response of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst needles after exposure to severe drought by quantitative RNA-sequencing. Drought stress induced extensive transcriptional changes comprising 2,402 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1,186 were up- and 1,216 downregulated.

'Abandoned, lost, discarded or otherwise lost fishing gear' (ALDFG) is a subgroup of plastic litter with special importance for environmental assessment because it has a defined source and may pose a health risk to animals. With the data provided, marine litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea was quantified and characterized with special regard to fishery as source. 72 litter items (LI) were collected within fishery catches by bottom trawling during three cruises in 2020 and 2021. The data were used to quantify litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea (9.2 LI/km\u00b2) including 2.2 LI/km\u00b2 ALDFG and 0.4 LI/km\u00b2 fishery nets. We conclude that fishery is an important source of litter and ALDFG represent a considerable share of marine litter with 22.2%."

Sample metadata, including primer sequences and barcode tags for demultiplexing (fields TagFWD, TagREV) are in the table `combined_sample_sheet.tsv`. The files in this archive differ from the read files submitted to ENA, which were demultiplexed and trimmed to remove technical sequences, following ENA requirements. This archive contains the raw reads prior to demultiplexing, in case changes to the demultiplexing pipeline are required."

Das Thuenen-Institut fuer Ostseefischerei fuehrt den rein nationalen Survey mit FFS Solea seit 2003 in festen Referenzgebieten (Boxen) durch. Die Boxen befinden sich in fuer die Ostsee charakteristischen Gebieten von der Kieler und ueber das Arkonabecken bis zur Oderbank. Die Beprobung erfolgt nach internationalem Standard (BITS), wobei die Boxen stets im Juni mit festen Stationen beprobt werden (~10 Tage Reisedauer). Es werden Daten zur Haeufigkeit, Laenge und Gewicht aller erfassten Arten erhoben. Auf jeder Station werden wichtige Hydrographiedaten zu Wassertemperatur, Salz- und Sauerstoffgehalt ermittelt. Der BaltBox Survey soll eine Basis fuer das Erkennen und Bewerten von Eingriffsfolgen liefern bzw. dazu beitragen eventuelle Summationswirkungen aus der Vielzahl von Eingriffen bzw. klimatischen Veraenderungen zu erfassen. Die westliche Ostsee stellt ein Uebergangsgebiet zwischen dem marin gepraegten Kattegat und der eigentlichen Ostsee dar. Sie zeichnet sich durch eine thermohaline Schichtung, einen hohen Salzgehaltsgradienten von West nach Ost sowie eine hohe Dynamik der hydrographischen Parameter aus. Das Fischartenspektrum und die Verbreitung der einzelnen Arten werden stark durch diese natuerlichen Phaenomene bestimmt."

Both systems worked independent from each other throughout the cruise. While temperature is taken at the water inlet in about 5 m depth, salinity is estimated within the interior TSG from conductivity and interior temperature. No correction against independent data was performed for temperature. Salinity was calibrated against independent water samples. Finally, TSG1 was chosen for publication. For details to all processing steps see Data Processing Report."

It includes all available data on Wilson's Storm Petrels from two colonies: around the Argentinian Base Carlini (62\u00b014\u2032S, 58\u00b040\u2032W; CA, formerly called Base Jubany) and the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station (62\u00b009\u2032S, 58\u00b027\u2032W; HA). Data on population productivity (number of nests, eggs, chicks and fledglings) was collected by regular visits to the colonies and searching for nest burrows, or monitoring of the egg or chick if found. Data on adult abundance and estimated age categories (i.e., presence of foot spots; Quillfeldt et al. (2000, doi:10.1007/s003000000167) were collected at CA by using the same size mistnet every study year in the same location within the breeding colony. Chicks were measured regularly (varying intervals depending on the study) at both CA and HA. Chick tarsus was measured using callipers (vernier or digital depending on the study year) to the nearest 0.1 mm, chick wing length was measured using wing rulers to the nearest 1 mm, and chick body mass was measured using mechanical or digital scales depending on the study year to the nearest 0.1 g. Chick growth rates were calculated based on the linear growth period following Ausems et al. (2020, doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138768). Chick food loads (g) were recorded at CA and determined based on changes in chick body mass on consecutive days (Gladbach et al. (2009, doi:10.1007/s00300-009-0628-z); Kuepper et al.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "A gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system determines fertility in sweet cherries and prevents pollination with own and genetically related pollen. This mechanism is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus coding for two genes involved in fertilization: the S allele-specific ribonuclease (S RNase) expressed in the female style and the S specific F-box protein (SFB) in the male pollen. Knowledge about the S genotype of sweet cherries is very important for cherry growers and breeders. Molecular markers have been developed to distinguish the S alleles in sweet cherries. In this new update from February 2023, a total of 72 incompatibility groups in 1700 sweet cherry cultivars have been listed. Twenty-six sweet cherry cultivars have a unique combination of S alleles, were described as universal donors and were categorized in the incompatibility group 0. Additionally, there exist 91 self-compatible (SC) sweet cherry genotypes belonging to the group SC. A total of 26 different S alleles were described in the cultivated sweet cherries up to date. These are the S alleles S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S9, S10, S12, S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19, S21, S22, S24, S27, S30, S37 and S38 (S7m), and the three mutated, non-functional S alleles S3', S4', S5'. This work summarizes all available data on S allele genotyping for in cultivated sweet cherries. Table 1 describes the S genotypes of all sweet cherries studied. It also contains information about the parentage, if known. Table 2 gives an overview about of all the defined incompatibility groups. The groups are sorted according to their group numbers or the S allele numbers, respectively. Table 3 lists all genotypes of the incompatibility group 0, which exhibit a unique S genotype. Table 4 includes all known self-compatible sweet cherry genotypes of the group SC. All published data used to describe of the S genotypes are listed in the file named 'References'. For S genotyping of sweet cherries, we have established a reference assortment including sweet cherry accessions for a large scale of S alleles (Table 5). These reference genotypes were planted in the orchard of the Julius Kuehn-Institut in Dresden-Pillnitz.The present dataset will be regularly updated and improved with all new S alleles data of sweet cherries. In addition, all new information about the parentage is very important for breeding research. Please send all news or corrections regarding the S allele genotype and parentage of sweet cherries to mirko.schuster@julius-kuehn.de or susan.schroepfer@julius-kuehn.de. An update of the S allele overview will be provide in the coming years."

When measuring the recovery rate, different collectors use different numbers of repeats. Here, between 5 and 50 repeats were used. Data on the recovery rate for all collectors during various time periods is presented on the sheet of storability. The collectors have different target concentrations, storage times, and repeat numbers. The final sheet shows the raw data used for the analysis of the UV-degradation of every collector. For 15 to 30 minutes, all collectors were exposed to UV radiation. For each collector, the number of repetitions was the same."

There are two files: One contains the raw data with measured C contents, delta 13C values, fraction weights and the subsequently calculated amounts of new and old carbon in all fractions.

Werden Hecken neu angelegt, kann zusaetzlich CO2 in der aufwachsenden Biomasse und im Boden langfristig gebunden werden. Hecken haben somit grosses Potential zum Klimaschutz beizutragen. An 9 Hecken in Schleswig-Holstein wurden destruktiv alle Biomassepools, ober- sowie unterirdisch beprobt. Zusaetzlich wurden die Bodenkohlenstoffvorraete im Vergleich zu einem angrenzenden Acker untersucht.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Marine litter at the seafloor comprises different materials. Plastic is the most frequent material of marine litter found at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea (55,6%). 'Abandoned, lost, discarded or otherwise lost fishing gear' (ALDFG) is a subgroup of plastic litter with special importance for environmental assessment because it has a defined source and may pose a health risk to animals. With the data provided, marine litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea was quantified and characterized with special regard to fishery as source. 72 litter items (LI) were collected within fishery catches by bottom trawling during three cruises in 2020 and 2021. The data were used to quantify litter at the seafloor of the Baltic Sea (9.2 LI/km\u00b2) including 2.2 LI/km\u00b2 ALDFG and 0.4 LI/km\u00b2 fishery nets. We conclude that fishery is an important source of litter and ALDFG represent a considerable share of marine litter with 22.2%. Methode Categorisation of litter Total litter comprises the sum of any item of obvious anthropogenic origin. Litter items (LI) were assigned to one of the six major categories: plastic, metals, rubber, glass/ceramics, natural products or miscellaneous. Subsequently, each item was classified into one of the 45 sub-categories. The eight sub-categories of metals were: cans (food), cans (beverage), fishing related, drums, appliances, car parts, cables and other. Rubber comprised the following six sub-categories: boots, balloons, bobbins (fishing), tyre, glove and other. The four sub-categories of glass/ceramics were the following: jar, bottle, piece and other. Natural products were sub-categorized into: wood (processed), rope, paper/cardboard, pallets and other. Miscellaneous comprise with clothing/rags, shoes and other three sub-categories. Stones or other non-anthropogenic items collected by the trawl are not defined as litter and were therefore omitted in this study. ALDFG litter as a sub group of total litter, was defined as sum of the following seven ICES sub-categories: A5 (fishery line monofilament), A6 (fishery line entangled), A7 (synthetic rope), A8 (fishery nets), A16 (other fishing related plastic), B3 (bobbins from fishery) and C3 (metal from fishery). Items from these sub-categories have a close link to the fishing gear itself. Fishery nets as a sub-group of ALDFG litter is represented by ICES sub-category A8 (fishery nets)."

The monitoring was conducted with a stow net, a stationary fishing gear deployed from a vessel at anchor while the tidal currents transport water and fish through the net. The original full data set for the fishes caught was obtained from the National Park Administration in Schleswig-Holstein (12.03.2024; Dr. Gabriele Mueller) and used to prepare the current data product, for which haul data were first standardized to the volume of water fished. Subsequently, for each of the standard monitoring stations, annual means of fish abundance and biomass were calculated and supplemented with the individual fishes' taxonomy to provide the input data for subsequent analyses of temporal abundance and biomass trends."

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2021. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

The specimens were collected in March and April 2015 during cruise 383 of the fishery research vessel 'FFS Walther Herwig III' in the Eastern Central Atlantic. A pelagic midwater trawl ('Aalnet', Engel Netze, Bremerhaven Germany) with multiple opening-closing device with three net bags of 20 mm mesh size and 1.8 mm mesh size in the cod-end container was used for catching fish at three depth strata per station between 50 and 700 m depth. Fish was stored in phosphate buffered 4% formalin solution and later on land in laboratories, specimens were measured, weighed, and dissected to examine gonads and oocytes under a stereo microscope. Reproductive phases were assigned based on macroscopic inspection following the standardised terminology for reproductive development in fish by Brown-Peterson et al. (2011, doi:10.1080/19425120.2011.555724). Histological cross sections of selected individuals were used for validation. The Gonadosomatic Index was calculated as GSI = 100 x gonad mass / (total mass - gonad mass). Batch fecundities were determined with the gravimetric method, counting the most advanced eggs in weighed subsamples."

In many countries, forest attributes are monitored regularly through sample-based forest inventories. In combination with satellite imagery, data from such forest inventories have a great potential for developing large area tree species maps. Here, the high temporal and spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 has been useful for extracting vegetation phenology, information that may also be useful for improving forest tree species mapping. Thus, we generate cloud free time series with 5-day intervals from Sentinel-2 imagery and combine those with monthly Sentinel-1 backscatter composites to map the dominant tree species throughout Germany. Further, we incorporate information on topography, meteorology, and climate to account for environmental gradients in Germany. We use the German National Forest Inventory (NFI) as source for training data for a random forest classifier and for validation data to assess map accuracy. The optical Sentinel-2 data were downloaded, processes and structured in an analysis-ready data cube with the open-source software FORCE (Framework for operational radiometric correction for environmental monitoring; Frantz, D., 2019, doi.org/10.3390/rs11091124; https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ last accessed: 02. Nov. 2022). The preprocessed Sentinel-1 SAR data was obtained through the CODE-DE platform (https://code-de.org/en/portfolio/?q=Sentinel-1 last accessed: 02. Nov. 2022) and included in the ARD cube along with the environmental data. We used Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and environmental data from the two years 2017 and 2018 to generate the map with 11 tree species groups, including two broader deciduous tree classes (ODH: other deciduous trees with high life expectancy, ODL: other deciduous trees with low life expectancy), within the wooded forest area using a previously produced forest mask: Langner et al. (2022, doi.org/10.3220/DATA20221205151218). The reference data for model training and map validation is based on the third German National Forest Inventory which was recorded in 2011/2012 (https://www.bundeswaldinventur.de/en/third-national-forest-inventory, last accessed: 02. Nov. 2022). To exclude inventory plots where tree species composition might have changed in between 2012 and 2018, we used the forest disturbance maps by Senf et al. (2020, doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00609-y). The map accuracies were estimated based on a stratified estimator according to Stehman et al. (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207). Map accuracies were estimated for pure species stands in a first step and for the entire map, including mixed species stands, in a second step. The overall accuracy of pure-species stands is 87.07 \u00b1 0.3 % and 75.53 \u00b1 0.07 % for the entire map, including mixed-species stands.

In Kombination mit Satellitenbildern haben die Daten solcher Waldinventuren ein grosses Potenzial fuer die Erstellung grossflaechiger Baumartenkarten. Hier laesst sich durch die hohe zeitliche und raeumliche Aufloesung der Sentinel-1 und Sentinel-2 Satellitenbilder die Phaenologie und spektralen Eigenschaften der Baeume charakterisieren, welche das Kartieren von Baumarten ermoeglichen. Wir erstellen wolkenfreie Sentinel-2 Bildzeitreihen mit zeitlicher Aufloesung von 5 Tagen und kombinieren diese mit monatlichen Sentinel-1 backscatter Kompositen, um die dominierenden Baumarten fuer Deutschland zu kartieren. Ausserdem nutzen wir Informationen ueber Topographie, Meteorologie und Klima, um unterschiedliche Umweltbedingungen in Deutschland mit zu beruecksichtigen.

Die Referenzdaten fuer das Modelltraining und die Kartenvalidierung basieren auf den Daten der dritten Bundeswaldinventur, die 2011/2012 durchgefuehrt wurde (https://www.bundeswaldinventur.de/en/third-national-forest-inventory, letzter Zugriff: 02. Nov. 2022). Um Inventurflaechen auszuschliessen, auf denen sich die Baumartenzusammensetzung zwischen 2012 und 2018 geaendert haben, verwenden wir die Waldstoerungskarten von Senf et al. (2020, doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00609-y). Die Genauigkeit der Karte wurde auf der Grundlage eines stratifizierten Schaetzers nach Stehman et al. (2014, doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207) geschaetzt. Die Genauigkeit der Karten wurde in einem ersten Schritt fuer Reinbestaende und in einem zweiten Schritt fuer die gesamte Karte, einschliesslich der Mischbestaende, berechnet. Die Gesamtgenauigkeit fuer Reinbestaende betraegt 87,07 \u00b1 0,3 % und fuer die gesamte Karte, einschliesslich der Mischbestaende, 75,53 \u00b1 0,07 %.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "To achieve the desired greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation from bioenergy, emissions from feedstock production need to be low. These emissions mainly consist of direct soil-borne GHG emissions during feedstock cultivation and indirect emissions from land use change caused by the competition between first-generation biomass and food production. Marginal land, such as low mountain ranges, is particularly suitable for feedstock production due to the small impact on indirect land-use change. However, the most common biomass crop in Europe, maize (Zea mays L.), does not achieve its full yield potential in cold, wet conditions. On such sites, cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) could serve as an alternative to maize. As a perennial, cup plant provides soil protective benefits and many more versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate whether cup plant also provides nitrous oxide mitigation potential, a two-year field experiment was conducted to compare GHG emissions from cup plant and maize fields. GHG emissions were quantified using the closed chamber technique. Cup plant fields emitted on average 3.6\u00b14.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 a-1 (-85%) less than maize fields. This corresponded to 74.0\u00b194.1 g CO2-eq kWh-1 (-78%) less emissions per produced electrical power. However, the area (-34%) and nitrogen (-32%) productivity of cup plant were significantly lower than of maize. Hence, cup plant as a feedstock reduces direct field-derived GHG emissions compared with maize but, due to lower yields cup plant increases the risk of associated emissions from land-use change. Therefore, the increased sustainability of bioenergy from biogas by replacing maize with cup plant is heavily dependent on the performance of maize at these sites and on the ecosystem services of cup plant in addition to GHG savings."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Um die gewuenschte Einsparung von Treibhausgasemissionen (THG) mit Bioenergie zu erreichen, muessen die THG-Emissionen die im Zusammenhang mit dem Biomasseanbau verursacht werden gering sein. Diese Emissionen setzen sich aus direkten THG-Feldemissionen waehrend des Biomasseanbaus und den indirekten Emissionen aus der Landnutzungsaenderung zusammen, die durch die Flaechenkonkurrenz zwischen Biomasseanbau und Nahrungsmittelproduktion verursacht werden. Grenzertragsstandorte wie die deutschen Mittelgebirge eignen sich fuer den Biomasseanbau, da dort das Risiko fuer Emissionen aus indirekten Landnutzungsaenderungen gering ist. Jedoch ist an diesen nasskalten Mittelgebirgsstandorten die haeufigste Biomassekultur, der Silomais (Zea mays L.), ertragsschwach. Als Alternative zum Mais koennte an solchen Standorten die Durchwachsene Silphie (Silphium Perfoliatum L.) dienen. Als eine mehrjaehrige Kultur bietet die Durchwachsene Silphie diverse Oekosystemdienstleistungen und traegt besonders zum Bodenschutz bei. Um zu bewerten, ob der Anbau der Durchwachsene Silphie auch das Potenzial hat direkte Lachgasemissionen (N2O) einzusparen im Vergleich zum Mais, wurde ein zweijaehriger Feldversuch durchgefuehrt. Die THG-Emissionen wurden mit der Closed-Chamber-Technik quantifiziert. Silphieflaechen emittierten durchschnittlich 3,6 \u00b14,3 kg N2O-N ha-1 a-1 (-85%) weniger als Maisflaechen. Dies entsprach 74,0 \u00b194,1 g CO2-eq kWh-1 (-78%) weniger Emissionen pro erzeugter Einheit elektrischer Energie. Allerdings waren die Flaechen- (-34%) und die Stickstoff- (-32%) Produktivitaet der Durchwachsenen Silphie deutlich geringer als im Mais. Daher reduziert der Anbau der Durchwachsenen Silphie die direkten THG-Feldemissionen im Vergleich zum Mais, erhoeht jedoch aufgrund der niedrigeren Ertraege das Risiko von Emissionen aus Landnutzungsaenderungen. Daher haengt das THG-Einsparpotenzial der durchwachsenen Silphie neben den direkten THG-Feldemissionen auch vom Ertragspotenzial des Maises an den gewaehlten Standorten ab."

Using measurement data from the EmiDaT project [1], digital twins of three naturally ventilated cattle barns (barn I, barn II, barn III) were developed and validated. Barn I featured a slatted floor with a manure pit underneath, barn II had a slatted floor with external manure storage, and barn III had a solid floor with manure also stored externally. The boundary conditions used for the simulations can be found on the first sheet of the respective Excel files, and the results of the validation simulations are on the second sheet. After successful validation, simulations were carried out for events that were not covered by the measurement periods of the EmiDaT data. For this purpose, weather data from nearby measurement stations operated by the German Weather Service were evaluated. The boundary conditions for these simulations are provided on the third sheet of the Excel file, and the corresponding results are on the fourth sheet. This approach demonstrated that simulations can extend the data basis beyond the available measurement data. This can lead to improved estimates of annual emission behavior and better extrapolation of emission factors. [1] KTBL.

The four species were settled on potted grapevine plants for a period of 6 hours and the feeding activities performed by these insects, from stylet insertion into the plant to withdrawal were recorded by DC-EPG coupled with Stylet+d software. Characteristic waveforms were marked with Stylet+a software and analysed by the macro XylFeed. The raw data of the sequential and non-sequential EPG parameters generated by the XylFeed are reported in this database as part of the connected publication."

It presents the result of a field survey, which was conducted from 2010 to 2014 on a total of 78 plots. Among the 30 vineyards, 25 of them were organically and 5 conventionally managed vineyards. Among them there were partly vineyards with a very long management history (>100 years) and thus very high anthropogenic copper contamination, as well as young vineyards. To evaluate the resilience of expected negative effects on soil organism communities, former vineyards, now fallows, were included in this study at each site. These land had been out of cultivation for more than 20 years at the time of sampling (24 areas in total). Furthermore, uncultivated meadows were included at each site, which served as a reference of the investigated site without copper application (a total of 24 areas). For anonymization and in agreement with the farmers, the investigated area are not geo referenced. Only regions and area IDs are given, so that it is not possible to trace the data. The dataset consists 9 excel tables including data description, methods used and information on management history of all studied plots. The Excel file contains information on soil physicochemical parameters like pH-value, C/N, SOM, eCEC, heavy metal and nutrient contents in soil, with a special focus on copper, and mobile Cu contents from NH4NO3- and CaCl2-extraction. Earthworm data include earthworm species, earthworm abundance, biomass, and heavy metal contents in earthworm tissue. The dataset is supplemented with microbiological summary parameters of long-term respiration, microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, and metabolic quotient. The data will enable other researchers to perform statistical (meta-)analyses on the effects of copper on soil organisms."

To test if the perennial crop (cup plant, Silphium perfoliatum L.) has lower N2O emissions due to an increased reduction of N2O to N2 under moist to water conditions than an annual crop (maize, Zea mays L.), we conducted an incubation experiment. We incubated intact soil cores (35 cm height and 14.4 cm diameter) from a maize and a cup plant field and exposed them to increasing waterlogging in three consecutive phases (drainage, 1/3 and 2/3 waterlogged). Source specific N2O and N2 emissions were measured with the 15N gas flux method in an N2 reduced atmosphere. In both soils two N levels were established (60 and 120 kg N ha-1). N2O emissions from the cup plant soil were 33.6 \u00b178.1 mg N m-2 and 95.8 \u00b164.4 mg N m-2 higher than from the maize soil in the 60N and 120N treatment, respectively. With increasing waterlogging, in cup plant soil the product ratio of denitrification (N2Oi=N2O/(N2+N2O)) was lower than in maize soil. The results did not show N2O mitigation from cup plant soil, instead highlighted the complexity of plant-soil effects on denitrification. This study showed that the N2Oi varies widely in agricultural soils between annual and perennial cropping."

Inwiefern die geringeren N2O Emissionen in dem mehrjaehrigen System (Durchwachsene Silphie, Silphium perfoliatum L.) im Vergleich zum einjaehrigen System (Mais, Zea mays L.) durch eine verstaerkten Reduktion von N2O zu N2 zu erklaeren sind, haben wir in einem Bodeninkubationsversuch unter feuchten bis staunassen Bedingungen getestet. Dafuer wurden ungestoerte Bodenkerne (35 cm Hoehe und 14.4 cm Durchmesser) aus einem Mais- und einem Silphiefeld inkubiert. Der Inkubationsversuch bestand aus drei aufeinander folgenden Phasen mit zunehmender Staunaesse (Entwaessert, Stauwasser in 1/3 und 2/3 des Bodens). In beiden Boeden wurde ein 60 und ein 120 kg N ha-1 N-Level etabliert. N2O und N2 Emissionen wurden mit der 15N Gasflussmethode in N2-reduzierter Atmosphaere gemessen. Der Silphieboden emittierte in der 60N Variant 33.6 \u00b178.1 mg N m-2 und in der 120N Variante 95.8 \u00b164.4 mg N m-2 mehr N2O als der Maisboden. Mit ansteigendem Stauwasserspiegel hatte der Silphieboden ein niedrigeres Produktverhaeltnis der Denitrifikation (N2Oi=N2O/(N2+N2O)) als der Maisboden. Im Versuch konnten keine geringeren N2O-Emissionen aus dem Silphieboden nachgewiesen werden. Insgesamt konnte in dem Versuch gezeigt werden, dass komplexe Effekte von Kulturart und Boden auf die Denitrifikation einwirken und dadurch das N2Oi zwischen unterschiedlichen ackerbaulichen Produktionssystemen stark variieren kann."

Multiple clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAI subtypes were responsible for increased mortality in wild birds and high mortality and massive losses in the poultry sector. To clarify putative entry sources and delineate interconnections between outbreaks in poultry holdings and wild birds, we applied whole-genome sequencing and phylodynamic analyses combined with the results of epidemiological outbreak investigations. Varying outbreak dynamics of the distinct reassortants allowed for the identification of individual, putatively wild bird-mediated entries into backyard holdings, several clusters comprising poultry holdings, local virus circulation for several weeks, direct farm-to-farm transmission and potential reassortment within a turkey holding with subsequent spill-over of the novel reassorted virus into the wild bird population. Here we present a joint analysis of the local German virus sequences with a set of international sequences underlining the clustering of the proposed groups, show international occurring reassortants and do not suggest the involvement of viruses from international poultry outbreaks in German."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2023. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. The map was derived from time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and additional environmental data. Map production is based on the methods described in Blickensdoerfer et al. (2022). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). Version v202: Additional post-processing was performed to detect and mask additional non-plausible areas that were not adequately covered by the first post-processing (e.g., areas with sparse vegetation, montane forests) based on the \u201eOekosystematlas Deutschland' (\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt, Deutschland, 2024). As a consequence, the current version includes a new class 'Small woody features on other land'. Furthermore, the class 'permanent grassland' was refinded. Each pixel that was classified as 'cultivated grassland' in at least five years (between 2017 and 2022) was translated to 'permanent grassland' in the annual maps. The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

Data were visualized by boxplots. Then, linear mixed models were fitted (R function 'lmer'). Specifically, all the outcomes of interest ('a') were modeled depending on treatment groups as fixed effect ('Groups') and a random intercept effect ('Number'). As explorative analysis, Dunnett's tests for comparisons of the treatment groups versus a control group were conducted and visualized by confidence intervals. Specifically, two approaches were employed to assess the significance of pairwise comparisons between the treatment and two control groups."

Here, we present phylogeographic evidence that Iceland has been used as a stepping stone for HPAIV translocation from Northern Europe to North America in 2021 and describe two independent incursions of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses of two different genotypes to Iceland in 2021 and 2022."

Six Aedes invasive mosquito (AIM) species were introduced to Europe since the 1970s: Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus, Ae. koreicus, Ae. atropalpus and Ae. triseriatus. Here, we report the results of AIMSurv2020, the first pan-European surveillance effort for AIMs. Implemented by 42 volunteer teams from 24 countries. And presented in the form of a dataset named 'AIMSurv Aedes Invasive Mosquito species harmonized surveillance in Europe. AIM-COST Action. Project ID: CA17108'. AIMSurv2020 harmonizes field surveillance methodologies for sampling different AIMs life stages, frequency and minimum length of sampling period, and data reporting. Data include minimum requirements for sample types and recommended requirements for those teams with more resources. Data are published as a Darwin Core archive in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility- Spain, comprising a core file with 19,130 records (EventID) and an occurrences file with 19,743 records (OccurrenceID). AIM species recorded in AIMSurv2020 were Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus and Ae. koreicus, as well as native mosquito species."

The prediction of liquid manure effects on N transformations in soils and the associated N2O and N2 fluxes is poor because previous investigations have mostly excluded N2. The objectives of this study were thus to quantify N2, N2O and CO2 fluxes, the source processes of N2O, N2O reduction and the depth distribution of moisture, NO3-, NH4+, water-extractable organic carbon concentration and pH in a laboratory incubation study with sandy arable soil using 15N tracing to quantify N processes and gaseous fluxes. The soil was amended with and without artificial slurry in various manure treatments (control, surface and injected) and incubated for 10 days at varying moisture levels, where the depth distribution of control parameters was determined twice during the experiment. Manure application was found to increase N2 and N2O fluxes from denitrification, with the highest fluxes occurring in the wet manure injection treatment (33\u00b132 mg N m-2 d-1 and 36.1\u00b139.1 mg N m-2 d-1, respectively), confirming that manure injection under wet conditions enhances denitrification and possibly also N2O fluxes. This study concluded that the current dataset is suitable as a first step towards improving the capability of biogeochemical models to predict manure application effects, but further studies with more soils and refined experiments are needed.

In addition, a correction of the the unit in the column 'position' of 3-Genotypic data was made. Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) causes high yield losses in wheat and other cereals. To date, there is little known about WDV resistant/tolerant varieties and no known information about genomic regions responsible for resistance is available. To identify the relevant genes, a panel of 500 wheat accessions (1-Plant material) was phenotyped after artificial inoculation in gauze houses for virus titer, infection rate, plant height, and yield parameters compared to healthy controls (2-Phenotypic data). In addition, 85 T. aestivum - Ae. tauschii introgression lines, containing different chromosome segments of Ae. tauschii, were tested via greenhouse inoculation tests. Accessions with low susceptibility to WDV were found in domesticated wheats and wild relatives. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a subpanel comprising 250 hexaploid wheat cultivars genotyped with the 15k iSelect chip (3-Genotypic data) identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial resistance. To validate the QTL, biparental SSD (Single Seed Descent) and DH (Double-Haploid) populations were screened for WDV resistance and genotyped using the 25k iSelect SNP chip (5-Phenotypic and genotypic data of biparental populations)."

        {
          "dsDescriptionValue": "Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.

In 2019, soil samples were taken from the top 15 cm and chemical as well as biological soil characteristics including morphological identification of free-living nematodes were determined. Soils were further evaluated in a greenhouse assay for their ability to suppress pea root rot caused by Didymella pinodella, Fusarium avenaceum, and F. redolens. Table 1 'Agronomic data from pot experiments' contains all plant performance data of peas (dry and fresh matter yield, seedling mortality after transplanting, disease indices of the root and basal shoot). Data are given for each plot separately (raw data). Table 2 'Nematode family abundance' shows the morphologically identified nematode families and their abundance (nematodes in 100 ml soil) per plot. Nematode families are further characterized according to their feeding types (bacterivore, fungivore, herbivore, omnivore-carnivore) Table 3 'Bioindicators from NINJA (Nematode Indicator Joint Analysis;)' shows nematode based-bioindicators that were used in the publication and that were obtained after uploading the Table 2 to the NINJA platform (https://shiny.wur.nl/ninja/). This program automatically computes individual bioindicators based on nematode ecophysiology parameters published on the NEMAPLEX website http://nemaplex.ucdavis.edu/. The indicators were calculated for each field plot separately."

Sites were selected to maximize urban gradients across study sites, with a mean distance of 941 m (range: 158 - 2711 m) between adjacent sampling points. In parallel, a vegetation survey was conducted to characterise the local vegetation at each sampling point. The data set contains data of the wild bee abundance and richness at each sampling point and abundance of wild bees grouped depending on their traits (body size, nesting and pollen-collecting behaviour). The vegetation characterization contains proportion of canopy cover, mean proportion of vegetation cover at 50 - 100 cm height in early summer, species richness of flowering plants, and proportion of species of flowering plants with recording at multiple sampling events. Detailed information about the sampling and methodology can be found in the corresponding publication."

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2020. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

Several studies on the response of apple plants to ARD have been documented, but less is known about the genetic mechanisms behind this symptomatology. The aim of our work was to find differentially expressed genes in response to ARD in Malus by RNA sequencing. For this, we compared transcriptome data of the rootstock 'M9' (susceptible) and the wild apple genotype M. \u00d7robusta 5 (Mr5, tolerant) after cultivation in ARD soil and disinfected ARD soil, respectively. RNAseq of the 12 root samples resulted in 549.6 million raw reads, with an average of 46 million 100-bp single ended reads per sample. After quality control, 494.1 million reads were mapped to the apple reference genome (Malus \u00d7domestica cv. 'Golden Delicious' v1.1) and assigned to 72,569 Gene IDs (Dataset 1). Comparing ARD soil versus disinfected ARD soil, 1,206 DEGs were identified based on a log2 fold change, (LFC) \u2265 1 for up- and \u2264 -1 for downregulation (p< 0.05) (Dataset 2)."

To date, there is little known about WDV resistant/tolerant varieties and no known information about genomic regions responsible for resistance is available. To identify the relevant genes, a panel of 500 wheat accessions (1-Plant material) was phenotyped after artificial inoculation in gauze houses for virus titer, infection rate, plant height, and yield parameters compared to healthy controls (2-Phenotypic data). In addition, 85 T. aestivum - Ae. tauschii introgression lines, containing different chromosome segments of Ae. tauschii, were tested via greenhouse inoculation tests. Accessions with low susceptibility to WDV were found in domesticated wheats and wild relatives. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a subpanel comprising 250 hexaploid wheat cultivars genotyped with the 15k iSelect chip (3-Genotypic data) identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial resistance. To validate the QTL, biparental SSD (Single Seed Descent) and DH (Double-Haploid) populations were screened for WDV resistance and genotyped using the 25k iSelect SNP chip (5-Phenotypic and genotypic data of biparental populations)."

In this study, we present a new reference database for fish meta-barcoding based on mitochondrial genes. The Mare-MAGE database contains quality-checked sequences of the mitochondrial genes for 12S ribosomal RNA and Cytochrome c Oxidase I. All sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information- GenBank (NBCI-GenBank) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and have undergone intensive processing. They were checked for false annotations and non-target anomalies, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) and FishBase. The dataset is compiled in ARB-Home, FASTA and Qiime2 formats, and is publicly available from the Mare-MAGE database website (http://mare-mage.weebly.com/ and https://figshare.com/projects/MARE-MAGE_database_Fish/90917). It includes altogether 231,333 COI and 12S rRNA gene sequences of fish covering 19,506 species of 4,058 genera and 586 families."

We assessed CUE using 18O-labelled water in a paired-plot approach on soils collected from 19 farms across the subarctic region of Yukon, Canada, comprising 14 pairs of forest-to-grassland conversion and 15 pairs of forest-to-cropland conversion. Microbial CUE significantly increased following conversion to grassland and cropland. Land-use conversion resulted in a lower estimated abundance of fungi, while the archaeal abundance increased, as assessed by qPCR. Interestingly, structural equation modelling revealed that increases in CUE were mediated by a rise in soil pH and a decrease in soil C:N ratio rather than by shifts in microbial community composition, i.e. the ratio of fungi, bacteria and archaea. Our findings indicate a direct control of abiotic factors on microbial CUE via improved nutrient availability and facilitated conditions for microbial growth. The R code was developed under R v3.6.3 and adapted to work under version R v.4.1.2.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This dataset contains lists of yeast species associated with the oligolectic mining bee Andrena vaga, which is specialised on willow pollen (Salix spec.). We analysed the yeast community of seven different matrices of the early nest stage, using two methodological approaches (classical cultivation and DNA-metabarcoding). In May 2022, ten brood cells were excavated at one nesting site of A. vaga, and separated into pollen provision, egg and brood cell wall. On the same nesting site, ten pollen collecting adult females were sampled. The pollen from their scopae was scraped into individual collection tubes and their guts were dissected. Additionally, we sampled ten samples of catkin pollen from four male Salix alba trees. To recover the viable yeast community, we used classical cultivation. All seven matrices (pollen of willow catkins, inner brood cell walls, provisions, eggs, adult bee guts, and pollen collected on their scopae) are represented by ten sub-samples. For the cultivation of the brood cells, the inner wall was carefully washed with sterile Tween-water and a cotton bud in a sterile Petri dish, and the collected Tween-water was used for cultivation. All other sub-samples were suspended in Tween-water and cultivated on yeast extract-malt extract (YM) medium, supplemented with 500 mg/l chloramphenicol to prevent bacterial growth. Pure cultures were prepared for Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) using the Biotyper platform (Bruker Daltonics). Yeast isolates showing high confidence scores in pair-wise comparisons of MALDI-ToF MS spectra, were considered conspecifics and 1-2 representatives of each group were additionally identified using ribosomal gene sequencing. ITS2 DNA-metabarcoding was performed for the same set of matrices, but with pooled sub-samples. It was technically impossible to separate the brood cell wall from the surrounding soil matrix for DNA extraction. Thus, we analysed the consolidated soil of the brood cell wall; it is referred to as 'soil matrix' in the following. For ITS2 sequences, paired-end reads assembly, quality filtering, chimera checks, ITS2 region extraction, clustering of OTUs (3% dissimilarity), and taxonomic assignment were performed using the Pipits pipeline (Gweon et al., 2015). Representative OTU sequences were identified employing the NCBI GenBank sequence database, and in parallel employing the MycoBank sequence database. Unfortunately, the sequencing of the pollen from the catkin failed. Further methodological and analytical details are described in the associated paper by Gardein et al. (2025). The dataset compromises two tables: Table 'Rawdata_cultivation' includes columns for the seven matrices, the ten sub-sample for each matrix, the yeast species identified using MALDI-ToF MS, yeast species identified with ribosomal gene sequencing, identifier from the Catalogue of Life (COL), and an accession number of the strain for the collection of the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, GER). For Holtermanniella takashimae and Triodiomyces crassus the COL identifier were not available, why the identifier from Mycobank.org are mentioned. Table 'Rawdata_metabarcoding' includes columns for the matrices, species identified with ITS2 DNA-metabarcoding, identifier from the Catalogue of Life (COL), number of reads (summarised for all Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) of this species) and the proportion of reads per species relative to the total read number per matrix in percent. For Aspergillus candidus, Holtermanniella takashimae, Diddensiella parasantjacobensis, Penicillum soosanum and Thelonectria blackeriella the COL identifier were not available, why the identifier from Mycobank.org are mentioned. The COL identifier can be used with the following URL link: https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/[Identifier]"

All sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information- GenBank (NBCI-GenBank) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and have undergone intensive processing. They were checked for false annotations and non-target anomalies, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) and FishBase. The dataset is compiled in ARB-Home, FASTA and Qiime2 formats, and is publicly available from the Mare-MAGE database website (http://mare-mage.weebly.com/ and https://figshare.com/projects/MARE-MAGE_database_Fish/90917). It includes altogether 231,333 COI and 12S rRNA gene sequences of fish covering 19,506 species of 4,058 genera and 586 families."

We applied novel fast-response instruments in eddy-covariance setups for continuous determination of surface ammonia (NH3) and total reactive nitrogen (\u03a3Nr) fluxes using two different analytical devices. While high-frequency measurements of ammonia were measured with a quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer (QCL), a custom-built converter called TRANC coupled to a chemiluminescence detector was used for the determination of total reactive nitrogen. High-resolution data of surface-atmosphere fluxes of reactive compounds are still scarce, but highly desired for testing and validating local inferential and larger scale models. We provide access to campaign data including concentrations, fluxes and ancillary measurements of meteorological data. Campaigns were conducted in natural (forest) and semi-natural (peatland) ecosystem types. The published datasets stress the importance of recent advancements in laser spectrometry and help improve our understanding of the temporal variability of surface-atmosphere exchange in different ecosystems, thereby providing validation opportunities for inferential models simulating the exchange of reactive nitrogen. A dataset description paper with the title 'Reactive nitrogen fluxes over peatland and forest ecosystems using micrometeorological measurement techniques' has been published in the journal Earth System Science Data (https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/743/2022/)."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Dumped munitions contain various harmful substances which can affect marine biota like fish. One of them is mercury (Hg), included in the common explosive primer. Another is 4-aminodinitrotoluene (4-ADNT), an explosive-metabolite. 251 individual dab (Limanda limanda L.) caught at the dump site Kolberger Heide a and nearby reference sites in 2017 and 2018 were analysed. The table contain individual data on Hg, 4-aminodinitrotoluene, age, length, weight, sex and condition factor. Mercury at AAS For sample preparation, portions of muscle samples were freeze dried using a lyophilizer and subsequently homogenized using an agate mortar or an ultra turrax tube drive dispenser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) equipped with glass grinders respectively to obtain a dry sample powder suitable for Hg analysis. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, MLS, Leutkirchen, Germany). Known amounts (20-30 mg) of each sample were weighted into the boat containers (precleaned with nitric acid) of the DMA-80. Direct analysis for total Hg content was performed using a 10-level calibration with standards in 0.5 M nitric acid. The accuracy of the procedure was determined by analysis of Certified Reference Material (DORM-3 and DORM-4, both fish protein homogenates) obtained from the National Research Council (NCR) in Canada which was taken through the same analytical procedure as the samples. Details on reference materials are given in Table 1. All samples were analysed in triplicate. External quality assurance was done by successfully participation in laboratory proficiency tests (z-score 0.7) conducted by QUASIMEME (www.wepal.nl) designed for marine environment analytics. The limit of detection (LD) and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32,645 (DIN, 1994) with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, a LD of 0.080 \u00b5g/kg wet weight (w. w.) and a LQ of 0.230 \u00b5g/kg w. w. were determined for Hg. No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Recovery of the method was 100.3% and precision was 8.20%. Explosives at LC-MS/MS 5 \u03bcL of the final bile extract were injected on a column in an Agilent 1290 Infinity High-Performance-Liquid-Chromatograph coupled to an AB Sciex QTrap 5500 Triple Quadrupole/Ion-Trap Mass Spectrometer (HPLC-MS). Gradient separation was achieved using an Acclaim Explosives E2 Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kept at 22 \u00b0C. Ionization was conducted in negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mode. Explosives and selected metabolites were detected via a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode based on characteristic MS/MS transitions, previously optimized using commercially available standard substances. Characterisation of unknown compounds was achieved in scan-mode of the linear ion trap by selecting nitroaromatic compounds using a neutral loss scan targeting the loss of nitro-groups (m/z 46), followed by an enhanced product ion scan, producing a sensitive mass spectrum of the nitro-containing molecule. Abundances of explosive compounds were quantified via the internal standard 1,4-DNB and corrected for response factors. Response factors were determined using an external calibration covering the expected range of concentrations. The method used is described in detail by Koske et al. (2019). Limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ) for explosive compounds were calculated according to DIN 32645 (2008). LOD 4-ADNT: 2.8 ng/ml bile. LOQ 4-ADNT: 18.8 ng/ml bile."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Background: In Morocco, fish is an important protein source especially, even not exclusively, for coastal communities and marketed fresh all along the coastline. One of the main targets of coastal artisanal fisheries is the European conger (Conger conger, Linnaeus 1758), a widely distributed benthic predatory species of a maximum weight of up to 50 kg. However, information on heavy metal contamination of conger is scarce. Therefore, concentrations of mercury, lead and cadmium were analysed in 108 European conger specimens from nine locations along the along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Morocco to describe the spatial distribution of heavy metal contamination. Results: The average heavy metal concentration in all conger samples under investigation was 246.90 \u00b1 216.83 \u03bcg mercury/kg wet mass, 74.14 \u00b1 87.02 \u03bcg lead/kg wet mass and 255.12 \u00b1 287.15 \u03bcg cadmium/kg wet mass respectively. Mercury and cadmium showed a clear site\u2011specific bioaccumulation in European conger but lead does not. Hence, the effect of fish length bias on contamination was corrected through a generalized linear model (GLM) prior to any spatial comparison. Conclusions: Different regional hotspots for the three analysed metals are identified and local sources are discussed. Mercury levels in big specimens of European conger exceeded the European threshold level for human consumption at some of the locations under investigation. Method: Hg determination Briefly, 2 g of muscle tissue samples were freeze dried using a lyophilizer (LD 1-2, Christ, Osterrode, Germany) and subsequently homogenized using an agate mortar or an ultra turrax tube drive dispenser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) to obtain a dry and homogenous sample powder. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, MLS, Leutkirchen, Germany). 20-30 mg of each sample was weighted into the boat containers of the DMA-80. Direct analysis for total Hg content was performed using a 10-level calibration. The limit of detection (LD) and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32645 [12] with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, an LD of 0.08 \u03bcg/kg wet mass (WM) and a LQ of 0.23 \u03bcg/kg WM were determined for Hg. No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Precision of the method was 8.2% and recovery was 100.3%.

Cd and Pb determination Quantification of Cd and Pb was performed in liver samples, defatted according to Smedes which have been subsequently freeze-dried and homogenized as described above. Dry and fat-free sample powder (1-5 mg) was weighted and placed into the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAAS) ContrAA 600 (Analytik Jena, Germany) with a continuous source. The GFAAS was calibrated using a 5-level calibration diluted from certified standard solutions in 0.1 M nitric acid. Measurements were performed after adding 5 \u03bcg of palladium matrix modifier (Pd(NO3)2 in nitric acid) to each sample. The LD and the limit of quantification (LQ) were calculated from a standard curve according to DIN 32645 with a confidence level of 99%. Considering the sample preparation, a LD of 0.25 (2.61) \u03bcg/kg WM and an LQ of 0.74 (7.82) \u03bcg/kg WM were determined for Cd (Pb). No values below these limits were found in any sample under investigation. Precision of the method was 15.4 (6.0%) and recovery was 84.1 (96.1) % for Cd (Pb)."

The short-term temperature sensitivity as well as N-input effects on microbial CUE, respiration, growth and turnover were assessed in a one-day incubation experiment according to the 18O-CUE approach. The warming and N response of SOM decomposition were assessed in a 50-days incubation experiment via measurement of cumulative respiration. Both experiments were conducted with the following three treatments: incubation at 10 \u00b0C, incubation at 20 \u00b0C, and incubation at 20 \u00b0C plus N-fertiliser addition at an amendment rate of 100 kg N ha-1. The response to warming or N addition were expressed as response ratios RRT = 20\u00b0C/10\u00b0C and RRN = 20\u00b0C+N/20\u00b0C for warming and N response, respectively.

Gefoerdert wurden das Projekt Win-N und die zugehoerige Datenbank durch das Bundesministerium fuer Ernaehrung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL) unter dem FKZ 2220NR082A. Die Win-N-DB-Thuenen wurde in Microsoft Access entwickelt. Die Messkampagien umfassen sowohl Stickstoff-Emissionen als auch agronomische Parameter und wurden an drei verschiedenen Feldversuchsstandorten, einem Praxis- sowie einem Lysimeterstandort in der Zeit von 03/2021 bis 10/2023 durchgefuehrt."

This dataset counts with data shared by the BeOne partners and comprises a total of 3,884 isolates, from which the anonymized sequencing reads were released in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the anonymized genome assemblies in the Zenodo repository [1,426 L. monocytogenes (accession: PRJEB57166 and 10.5281/zenodo.7267486 ); 1,540 S. enterica (accession: PRJEB57179 and 10.5281/zenodo.7267785 ); 308 E. coli (accession: PRJEB57098 and10.5281/zenodo.726784 4); 610 C. jejuni (accession: PRJEB57119 and 10.5281/zenodo.7267879 )]. As a complement to the BeOne dataset, additional samples were carefully selected among the WGS data publicly available at the beginning of the analysis (November 2021) in ENA or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA), in order to ensure the representativeness of the genomic diversity within public databases (assessed in terms of sequence type or serotype, depending on the species). In the end, a so-called 'public dataset' with the 8,383 samples that passed the curation step was released in Zenodo repository [1,874 L. monocytogenes (accession: 10.5281/zenodo.7116878 ); 1,434 S. enterica (accession: 10.5281/zenodo.7119735 ), 1,999 E. coli (accession: 10.5281/zenodo.7120057 ); 3,076 C. jejuni (accession: 10.5281/zenodo.7120166 )]."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The underlying data sets contain references from a literature survey that was undertaken using the Web of Science Core Collection database. The data set (Du_Perez_etal_2021_references.ris) contains all references (672) that were used to create the figures in the corresponding paper with the focus on nematode-based bioindicators (NBIs). The data set (Du_Perez_et_al_2021.xlsx) contains all references added by information about NBIs, location information, spatial scale, land use, land cover and study focus which are explained below. We identified three scientific papers, namely Bongers (1990), Ferris et al. (2001), and Ferris (2010), that serve as the foundation and main reference works for scientists and researchers that report on the application of NBIs. In total, 11 NBIs were used in these studies, namely Maturity Index, Maturity Index 2-5, Plant-parasitic Index, Sigma maturity index, Colonizer-Persister (CP) -Triangle, Enrichment Index, Structure Index, Basal Index, Channel Index, Food Web Analysis, and Metabolic footprints. Using the Cited Reference Search tool, a search was conducted for works (up until the end of 2020; last search performed 31 March 2021) that cited each of the above-mentioned scientific papers. This returned 1 113, 653, and 122 citations, respectively, for the Bongers (1990), Ferris et al. (2001), and Ferris (2010) papers. The results were combined, duplicates removed, and further refined to include only peer-reviewed scientific articles. Furthermore, all marine and freshwater studies were excluded. Finally, a total of 1199 papers was included in the analyses. The next step was to screen each paper to assess whether it met the following basic criteria: 1) empirical study (therefore not a review or meta-analysis), 2) application of at least one NBI, and 3) focused on terrestrial habitat(s). A total of 672 scientific papers met these criteria and, from them, the following information was extracted and recorded: i) which NBIs were applied, ii) location information and spatial scale of the study site(s), iii) study focus, and iv) land use and land cover information. The study foci were identified based on the knowledge and experience of the authors. The land use and land cover criteria, in turn, were based on SEEA (2012), which defines land use as 'the activities undertaken and the institutional arrangements put in place for a given area for the purposes of economic production, or the maintenance and restoration of environmental functions'. Land use therefore classifies all areas under human management according to its use into five categories namely: 'forestry', 'not in use', 'agriculture', 'built-up and related', and 'maintenance and restoration' . Land cover, in turn, is defined by as 'the observed physical and biological cover of the Earth's surface and includes natural vegetation and abiotic (non-living) surfaces'. Six land cover categories were recognized, namely 'sparse', 'grassland', 'tree-covered', 'shrub-covered', 'herbaceous crops', and 'woody and multi crop'. The 'sparse' category represents both barren terrestrial land and sparsely vegetated land. Further information on each land use and land cover category is provided in the section 3.3. The above mentioned references are as follows: Bongers, T., 1990. The maturity index: an ecological measure of environmental disturbance based on nematode species composition. Oecologia 83, 14-19. and Ferris, H., 2010. Form and function: metabolic footprints of nematodes in the soil food web.

Daher haben wir fuer die Projektregionen die Erreichbarkeit ausgewaehlter Infrastrukturen mittels verschiedener Verkehrstraeger mit dem Thuenen-Erreichbarkeitsmodell analysiert. Um die globale Erreichbarkeitssituation in den einzelnen Projektregionen abzuschaetzen, haben wir die Erreichbarkeit folgender Infrastrukturen zu einem Index \u201emittlere bevoelkerungsgewichtete Erreichbarkeit' zusammengefasst: Oeffentliche Apotheken, Hausarzt, Kinderarzt, Zahnarzt, Krankenhaus, Supermaerkte und Discounter, Kindergarten, allgemeinbildende Schulen (Grundschule, Schulen mit Sekundarstufe I, und II), Unterzentrum, Mittel- und Oberzentrum, Haltestelle des oeffentlichen Verkehrs (OePNV). Das Ergebnis ist in der Tabelle dargestellt. Es laesst sich erkennen, dass es sowohl zwischen den Untersuchungslandkreisen als auch den Untersuchungsgemeinden nur wenige nennenswerte Erreichbarkeitsunterschiede innerhalb einer Verkehrsmittelkategorie gibt. Die besten Erreichbarkeiten ergeben sich fuer Buerger*innen, die einen Pkw nutzen koennen, gefolgt von denjenigen, die den OePNV nutzen koennen. Die Ergebnisse fuer die restlichen im Projekt untersuchten Infrastrukturen koennen im Thuenen Working Paper 122 (Neumeier 2019) eingesehen werden, auf das ueber folgenden Link zugegriffen werden kann: https://literatur.thuenen.de/digbib_extern/dn061014.pdf"

In Abhaengigkeit vom konkreten Wohnort kann es aber sein, dass dort wichtige Infrastrukturen nur schwer erreicht werden koennen, was negative Auswirkungen auf die Teilhabechancen der Betroffenen haben kann. Daher haben wir fuer die Projektregionen die Erreichbarkeit ausgewaehlter Infrastrukturen mittels verschiedener Verkehrstraeger mit dem Thuenen-Erreichbarkeitsmodell analysiert. Die Abbildung zeigt exemplarisch, wie sich innerhalb der Untersuchungsregionen die Erreichbarkeit der naechsten Haltestelle des oeffentlichen Personenverkehrs darstellt. Je blauer, umso kuerzer die Reisezeit, je oranger, umso laenger. Es zeigen sich deutliche Erreichbarkeitsunterschiede in Abhaengigkeit vom nutzbaren Verkehrstraeger sowie innerhalb der Regionen in Abhaengigkeit vom konkreten Wohnort. Die Ergebnisse fuer die restlichen im Projekt untersuchten Infrastrukturen koennen im Thuenen Working Paper 122 (Neumeier 2019) eingesehen werden, auf das ueber folgenden Link zugegriffen werden kann: https://literatur.thuenen.de/digbib_extern/ dn061014.pdf"

(2023)[4], and the Freedom House databank[5]. The data are stored as a complete dataset in an Excel table containing five data sheets. There is i.) an overview over all data for dependent and independent variables (drivers), ii.) metadata of all dependent and independent variables (drivers), iii.) complete dataset of all variables and their corresponding values, iv.) dataset used to estimate development models for planted forest area including the dependent variable and 33 respective independent variables (drivers), and v.) dataset used to estimate development models for natural forest area containing the dependent variable and 26 respective independent variables (drivers) and vi.) correlation matrix to highlight potential intercorrelations within all drivers (before starting the regularization methods). These data are used in a holistic econometric assessment on the relevance and difference of multiple drivers for the development of natural forests as well as planted forests, including plantations. The raw data had been cleaned prior to modelling to create complete datasets for the two endogenous variables ((i) planted forest, including plantations, and (ii) natural forest), without using imputation techniques. Out of the initial 95 independent variables (drivers), only 33 independent variables, represented by 800 sets of complete data, remain as input for modelling planted forest area development while only 26 drivers, represented by 950 sets complete data, remain for natural forests. These data are then used in different machine learning approaches, which first identify the relevant independent variables (drivers) for the respective dependent variable, and subsequently assess significance, impact and direction of selected drivers.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This dataset is the result of an online survey the authors conducted in the German agricultural science community in 2020. The survey inquires not only about the status quo, but also explicitly about the wishes and needs of users, representing the agricultural scientific research domain, of the in-progress NFDI (national research data infrastructure). Questions cover information about produced and (re-)used data, data quality aspects, information about the use of standards, publication practices and legal aspects of agricultural research data, the current situation in research data management in regards to awareness, consulting and curricula as well as needs of the agricultural community in respect to future developments. In total, the questionnaire contained 52 questions and was conducted using the Community Edition of the Open Source Survey Tool LimeSurvey (Version 3.19.3; LimeSurvey GmbH). The questions were accessible in English and German. The first set of questions (Questions 1-4) addressed the respondent's professional background (i.e. career status, affiliation and subject area, but no personal data) and the user group. The user groups included data users, data providers as well as infrastructure service and information service providers. Subsequent questions were partly user group specific. All questions, the corresponding question types and addressed user groups can be found in the questionnaire files (Survey-Questions-2020-DE.pdf German Version; Survey-Questions-2020-EN.pdf English Version). The survey was accessible online between June 26th and July 21st 2020, could be completed anonymously and took about 20 minutes. The survey was promoted in an undirected manner via mail lists of agricultural institutes and agricultural-specific professional societies in Germany, via social media (e.g. Twitter) and announced during the first community workshop of NFDI4Agri on July 15th 2020 and other scientific events. After closing the survey, we exported the data from the LimeSurvey tool and initially screened it. We considered all questionnaires that contained at least one answered question in addition to the respondent's professional background information (Questions 1-4). In total, we received 196 questionnaires of which 160 were completed in full (although not always every answer option was used, empty cells are filled with 'N/A'). The main data set contains all standardized answers from the respondents. For anonymization, respondents' individual answers, for instance, free text answers, comments and details in the category 'other' were removed from the main data set. The main data set only lists whether such information was provided ('Yes') or not ('No' or 'N/A'). In an additional file respondents' individual answers of the questions 4-52 are listed alphabetically, so that it is not possible to trace the data back. In the rare cases where only one person has provided such individual information in an answer, it is traceable but does not contain any sensitive data. The main data set containing answers of the 196 questionnaires received can be found in the file Survey-2020-Main-DataSet-Answers.xlsx. The subsidary data set containing the respondents' individual answers (most answers are in German and are not translated) of the questions 4-52, for instance, free text answers, comments and details in the category 'other' (alphabetically listed) can be found in Survey-2020-Subsidary-DataSet-Free_Text_Answers.xlsx."

Current models were developed before suitable soil N2 flux data were available, which may have led to inaccuracies in how denitrification was described. New measurement techniques, using gas chromatography and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), have enabled the collection of more robust N2, N2O and CO2 data. We incubated two arable soils - a silt-loam and a sand soil - for 34 and 58 d, respectively, with small field-relevant changes made to control factors during this period. For the silt-loam soil, seven treatments varying in moisture, bulk density and NO3- contents were included, with temperature changing during the incubation. The sandy soil was incubated with and without incorporation of litter (ryegrass), with temperature, water content and NO3- content changing during the incubation. The denitrification and decomposition sub-modules of DeNi, Coup and DNDC were tested using the data. No systematic calibration of the model parameters was conducted since our intention was to evaluate the general model structure or 'default' model runs. Measured fluxes generally responded as expected to control factors. We assessed the direction of modeled responses to control factors using three categories: no response, a response in the same direction as measurements or a response in the opposite direction to measurements. DNDC responses were 14 %, 52% and 34 %, respectively. Coup responses were 47 %, 19% and 34 %, respectively. DeNi responses were 0 %, 67% and 33 %, respectively. The magnitudes of the modeled fluxes were underestimated by Coup and DNDC and overestimated by DeNi for the sandy soil, while there was no general trend for the silt-loam soil. None of the models was able to determine litter-induced decomposition correctly. To conclude, the currently used sub-modules are not able to consistently simulate the denitrification and decomposition processes. For better model evaluation and development, we need to design better experiments, take more frequent measurements, use new or updated measurement techniques, address model complexity, add missing processes to the models, calibrate denitrifier microbial dynamics, and evaluate the anaerobic soil volume concept.

Likewise, changes in socio-political conditions influencing consumer demand, fuel and fish prices may jeopardize the viability of fisheries. Predicting whether existing management systems can adapt to these changes is key and especially challenging in data-poor fisheries. In the Mediterranean Sea, the sub-tropical dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is at its northernmost reproductive distribution area and has sustained a seasonal age-0 based artisanal fishery since ancient times. We built a quantitative Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model integrating a diverse set of ecological, social and economic input data to assess the impact of plausible mid-term futures (2040-2059) on the seasonal economic profit for dolphinfish fishers in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean). These future scenarios accounted for increasing sea surface temperature based on global IPCC projections, population dynamics and growth of dolphinfish, economic forecasts of future fish and fuel prices, and stakeholders' views on feasible adaptations of the local management system. The model was built under the Horizon 2020 project CERES and it was fully parameterised with quarterly aggregated local fisheries statistics data. For details on the model development, parameterisation and use please refer to the upcoming publication in Ecology & Society or contact the lead author."

(in prep.): Evaluation of genetic diversity of Helosciadium nodiflorum in Germany - A wild relative of celery. SSR data presented in the excel file were generated by HU Berlin, Germany. Helosciadium nodiflorum plants were sampled at 20 localities in 2015 or 2016 and analyzed using 17 polymorphic SSR markers. All individuals (86 in total) having a null allele at any of the marker loci were excluded from the dataset presented here. The raw data were binned and statistically analyzed in 2018-2019. The data sheet contains information on 514/600 plants in total, respectively. The genetic reserves for wild celery species are part of a nationwide 'Network of Genetic Reserves in Germany' (https://www.genres.de/fachportale/kultur-und-wildpflanzen/in-situ-erhaltung-von-wel/netzwerk-genetische-erhaltungsgebiete-deutschland/). The intraspecific diversity of wild celery species was assessed and representative plant populations maximizing this diversity were selected. A network of genetic reserves, comprising at least 45 plant populations, is to ensure that the intraspecific diversity of the wild celery relatives is preserved."

Thus, SOC models can be simply defined and run to predict the temporal development of SOC. Beyond this, SORCERING determines the fluxes of SON and N mineralisation / immobilisation. Basic inputs are (1) the model parameters of a given SOC model expressed as the C transfer matrix (including information on decomposition and transfer rates between model pools), (2) the initial distributions of C and N among model pools and (3) time series of C and N inputs and rate modulating environmental factors. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is used to numerically solve the system of differential equations."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Sustainability of biogas production is strongly dependent on soil-borne greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during feedstock cultivation. Maize (Zea mays) is the most common feedstock for biogas production in Europe. Since it is an annual crop requiring high fertilizer input, maize cropping can cause high GHG emissions on sites that, due to their hydrology, have high N2O emission potential. On such sites, cultivation of cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) as a perennial crop could be a more environmentally-friendly alternative offering versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate the possible benefits of perennial cup-plant cropping on GHG emissions and nitrogen losses, an incubation study was conducted with intact soil cores from a maize field and a cup plant field. The 15N gas flux method was used to quantify N source-specific N2 and N2O fluxes. Cumulated N2O emissions and N2+N2O emissions did not differ significantly between maize and cup plant soils, but tended to be higher in maize soil. Soils from both systems exhibited relatively high and similar N2O/(N2+N2O) ratios (N2Oi). N2O emissions originating from sources other than the 15N-labelled NO3 pool were low, but were the only fluxes exhibiting a significant difference between the maize and cup plant soils. Missing differences in fluxes derived from the 15N-pool indicate that under the experimental conditions with high moisture and NO3- level, and without plants, the cropping system had little effect on N fluxes related to denitrification. Lower soil pH and higher bulk density in the cup plant soil are likely to have reduced the mitigation potential of perennial biomass cropping."

Mais (Zea mays) ist das am haeufigsten verwendete Substrat in der Biogasproduktion in Europa. Da es sich beim Mais um eine einjaehrige Kultur mit hohem Duengebedarf handelt, kann der Maisanbau an Standorten, die aufgrund ihrer Hydrologie ein hohes N2O-Emissionspotenzial aufweisen, hohe THG-Emissionen verusachen. An solchen Standorten koennte der Anbau der Durchwachsenen Silphie (Silphium perfoliatum) als mehrjaehrige Kultur eine umweltfreundlichere Alternative sein, die zudem noch viele weitere Oekosystemdienstleistungen bietet. Um die moeglichen Vorteile des mehrjaehrigen Anbaus der Durchwachsenen Silphie auf THG-Emissionen und Stickstoffverluste, wurde ein Inkubationsversuch mit ungestoerten Bodensaeulen aus einem Mais- und Silphiefield durchgefuehrt. Dafuer wurde die 15N Gasflussmethode verwendet, um N2 und N2O quellenspezifisch zu quantifizieren. Die kumulierten N2O-Emissionen und die N2+N2O-Emissionen unterschieden sich zwischen Mais- und Silphieboden nicht signifikant, waren im Maisboden tendenziell hoeher. Die Boeden aus beiden Systemen wiesen relativ hohe und aehnliche N2O/N2+N2O Verhaeltnisse (N2Oi) auf. Die N2O-Emissionen, die aus anderen Quellen als dem 15N markierten NO3-Pool stammten, waren gering, aber die einzigen Emissionen, die sich signifikant zwischen den beiden Anbausystemen unterschieden. Fehlende Unterschiede in den Fluessen, die aus dem 15N-Pool stammten, wiesen darauf hin, dass das Anbausystem unter den Versuchsbedingungen mit hoher Bodenfeuchte, NO3-Gehalt und ohne Pflanzen wenig Einfluss auf die N-Emissionen aus der Denitrifikation hatte. Ein niedriger Boden-pH und eine hoehere Trockenrodichte in der Durchwachsenen Silphie haben wahrscheinlich das THG-Minderungspotenzial der mehrjaehrigen Kultur verringert."

Dieser Datensatz wurde verwendet, um ein binaeres Klassifikationsmodell mit eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, xgboost v1.7.8.1, R) zu trainieren, um eine effiziente und automatisierte Filterung von PAL-Signalen aus dem Gesamtdatensatz zu ermoeglichen."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Cherries are among the most popular fruits among consumers and are grown for industrial processing or fresh consumption. The cultivation and breeding of cherries faces new challenges in the future, not least due to climate change. Cultivation is becoming increasingly difficult due to changing climatic conditions, diseases and pests. Therefore, the market demands new varieties with high fruit quality and adaptation to locally changing conditions. Breeding for tree fruit is a long-term task, though, and tools to facilitate this process are unfortunately not yet available to a sufficient extent. Rapid progress in third-generation sequencing technologies enables breeders to explore and exploit the genomic information underlying economical important traits. We used Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION platform and R10.3 pore type to sequence the genome of tetraploid ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa). The final sequence has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession JAHHUK000000000. A specific description of the work can be viewed at https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.01.446499v1. The version described in this paper is version JAHHUK010000000. The data on this platform includes 17 files, supports the assembling and annotation procedure, and provides insights into this challenging work. As a result, five assemblies (MiniasmMinimap.fasta, medaka.fasta, raconpolished.fasta, purged.fasta, purged2.fasta) have been processed to generate a draft genome assembly. The final genome sequence was masked (genome.fa.masked.gz, genome.fa.out, genome.fa.tbl) and annotated using Braker 1 and Braker 2, GeMoMa pipeline and eight reference datasets from other Prunus species. The final structural annotation, coding sequences and protein predictions are provided for future studies (GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker.gff, GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker_assignment.tabular, GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker_cds-parts.fasta, GeMoMa_Annotation_filtered_predictions_8ref_RNAseq_Braker_proteins.fasta). The functional prediction was performed with InterProScan (Results IPS.xlsx). In addition, the sequences and annotation of the chloroplast (Pf_chloroplast_1.0.fasta, GeSeqJob-20210201-124142_utg000088l_segment0_1_GFF3.gff3) and mitochondrion (Pf_mitochondria_1.0, GeSeqJob-20210202-114557_utg001396l_trimmed_GFF3.gff3) are presented."

The StaPlaRes project targets the mitigation of nitrogen emissions with two innovative urea fertilizer application techniques (nitrogen stabilization with inhibitors and subsurface placement 'side dressing'). The resulting multi-variable data sets consists of gas concentrations (nitrous dioxide) and gas fluxes (nitrous dioxide and ammonia), crop parameters (ontogenesis, aboveground biomass, grain and straw yield, N content, etc.), soil measurements (nitrogen content, ammonium-N, nitrate-N etc.), continuously recorded meteorological variables (air and soil temperatures, global radiation, precipitation, wind speed), management activities (sowing, harvest, soil tillage, fertilization, crop protection, etc.), and its metadata (methods, further information about variables, etc.) for a three-year crop sequence / rotation. In addition to the field study, process-related investigations were carried out using lab (soil tests of nitrogen turnover, urease activity, NH3 volatilization potential), pot (nitrate leaching potential) and lysimeter experiments (nitrate leaching). Furthermore, N2 data were measured and analysed under laboratory conditions."

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2019. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains a map of the main classes of agricultural land use (dominant crop types and other land use types) in Germany for the year 2023. It complements a series of maps that are produced annually at the Thuenen Institute beginning with the year 2017 on the basis of satellite data. The maps cover the entire open landscape, i.e., the agriculturally used area (UAA) and e.g., uncultivated areas. The map was derived from time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and additional environmental data. Map production is based on the methods described in Blickensdoerfer et al. (2022). All optical satellite data were managed, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019), in which SAR and environmental data were integrated. The map extent covers all areas in Germany that are defined as agricultural land, grassland, small woody features, heathland, peatland or unvegetated areas according to ATKIS Basis-DLM (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2020). Version v201: Post-processing of the maps included a sieve filter as well as a ruleset for the reduction of non-plausible areas using the Basis-DLM and the digital terrain model of Germany (Geobasisdaten: \u00a9 GeoBasis-DE / BKG, 2015). The maps are available as cloud optimized GeoTiffs, which makes downloading the full dataset optional. All data can directly be accessed in QGIS, R, Python or any supported software of your choice using the URL that will be provided on request. By doing so the entire map area or only the regions of interest can be accessed. QGIS legend files for data visualization can be downloaded separately. Class-specific accuracies for each year are proveded in the respective tables. We provide this dataset 'as is' without any warranty regarding the accuracy or completeness and exclude all liability.

Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards an efficient usage of genetic resources and demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and greenhouse. It is a versatile tool, that offers the possibility to fully customize own descriptors/scales for any possible scenario or the usage of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. Furthermore, the simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). The embedding in international information standards such as MIAPPE or the implementation regarding FAIR data principles is feasible. PhenoApp is a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in breeding, breeding research and genebank management by accelerating the labor intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data."

(2) Raster data with complete cases for the predictors respected in the Automated modelling selection as data table (model_compl_cases.csv). The column names correspond to the raster data layer names. The variables are additionally described in the 'Table Structure' section. The data used for the submission counts are an export of the nationwide database 'CULBASE' that contained all data from mosquito monitoring since start of the nationwide monitoring programme in 2011. The CULBASE merged into the new database VECTORBASE in September 2020. Both databases are not publicly."

Furthermore, there is hardly information on the dissemination of soil conservation measures to avoid soil compaction. For this reason, we conducted a German-wide online survey among farmers on this topic in autumn/winter 2017/2018. A further aim was to collect information on the dissemination of new technologies (apps) and to identify possible gaps in information services. The quantitative survey was conducted with the software LimeSurvey. Farmers were invited via various channels (professional journals, mailing lists of interest groups, Thuenen homepage). The questionnaire contained the following thematic blocks: 1. general information on the farm, 2. soil compaction (perception and measures), 3. crop rotation and soil tillage, 4. technical equipment/process organisation (incl. contractors), 5. consulting and information offers (incl. apps).

Weiterhin gibt es kaum Informationen ueber die Verbreitung bodenschonender Massnahmen zur Vermeidung von Bodenverdichtung. Aus diesem Grund fuehrten wir im Herbst/Winter 2017/2018 eine deutschlandweite, online-Befragung unter Landwirt*innen zu diesem Thema durch. Ein weiteres Ziel war es, Informationen ueber die Verbreitung neuer Technologien (Apps) zu sammeln und moegliche Luecken bei Informationsangeboten aufzudecken. Die quantitative Befragung wurde mit der Software LimeSurvey durchgefuehrt. Landwirt*innen wurden ueber verschiedene Kanaele (Fachzeitschriften, Mail-Verteiler von Interessensgruppen, Thuenen Homepage) eingeladen. Der Fragebogen beinhaltete folgende Themenbloecke: 1. Allgemeine Angaben zum Betrieb, 2. Bodenverdichtung (Wahrnehmung und Massnahmen), 3. Fruchtfolge und Bodenbearbeitung, 4. Technische Ausstattung/Verfahrensorganisation (inkl. Lohnunternehmen), 5. Beratung und Informationsangebote (inkl. Apps)."

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2023. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

Ammoniak (NEC-Richtlinie). Im Rahmen dieser Abkommen muessen die nationalen Emissionen der entsprechenden Gase und Luftschadstoffe jaehrlich berechnet und in Form des Emissionsinventars an die zustaendigen Organisationen uebermittelt werden. Die Datendatei beinhaltet Inputdaten und Ergebnisse der Berechnung von gas- und partikelfoermigen Emissionen aus der deutschen Landwirtschaft fuer Deutschland und die Bundeslaender in den Jahren 1990 - 2023. Der Bereich Landwirtschaft umfasst dabei die Emissionen aus der Tierhaltung und der Nutzung landwirtschaftlicher Boeden sowie aus der Vergaerung von Energiepflanzen. Emissionen aus dem Vorleistungsbereich, aus der Nutzung von Energie sowie Landnutzungsaenderungen werden den Regelwerken entsprechend an anderer Stelle in den nationalen Inventaren berichtet."

The shapefile contains the information on land use type and plot Id. measurements: Remote sensing products provision for the CRC 990 project. The centre coordinate acquisition was carried out using an Emlid Reach RS2 multi-band RTK GNSS receiver operated by a local field assistant (Riji O Sitohang). equipment: Emlid Reach RS2: The Emlid Reach RS2 is a multi-band RTK (real time kinematic) receiver used for surveying, mapping and navigation. It can be used as a standalone system (single mode - Survey), acquiring coordinate position with a meters-level precision, or connected to a second receiver functioning as a base station (sub-meter precision). Use in Single mode (Survey function) was carried out with a default observation time (continuous static position acquisition) of 10 minutes, to provide the best possible position accuracy. A 10 minutes static observation time was selected for the collection of each Landscape Assessment plot, using the Survey function, within the Emlid Reachview app. Each position was then individually exported as a .shp file and collated together in QGIS to form the current dataset."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Grasslands provide a wide range of important ecosystem services. Mapping and assessing the status and use intensity of grasslands is thus important for environmental monitoring. We here provide maps with detected mowing events, as a proxy for grassland use intensity, for grassland areas across Germany for the years 2017 to 2020. The algorithm used to derive the maps is described in Schwieder, et al. (accepted) and is available as a user-defined function for the FORCE (Frantz, D., 2019) environment (https://github.com/davidfrantz/force-udf/tree/main/python/ts/mowingDetection). The here provided GeoTiffs contain a band with the number of detected mowing events per pixel for the repsective year. In the products, only stable grassland areas that were consistently classified as grassland within three years (2017 - 2019) were considered, based on crop maps provided by Blickensdoerfer et al. (2021). Note that grassland uses (pasture, mowed, mixed) were not separated prior to analysis. The maps for 2018, 2019, and 2020 were validated in different regions of Germany, with accuracies - in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error - ranging from 35% to 40% (for more details see Schwieder et al. accepted). The maps may thus give an indication of extensively or intensively grassland use. Please contact the authors, if you are interested in additional products e.g., regarding the estimated mowing dates. All satellite data were downloaded, pre-processed and structured in an analysis-ready data (ARD) cube using the open-source software FORCE - Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (Frantz, D., 2019; https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ last accessed: 15.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Datenmeldung nach dem EGovG. Der Datensatz kann auf Anfrage zur Verfuegung gestellt werden. Eine Datennutzungsvereinbarung wird abgeschlossen. Eine grosse Herausforderung im internationalen Fischhandel besteht nach wie vor darin, Hunderte von Fischarten zuverlaessig von moeglichen Ersatzprodukten zu unterscheiden, die moeglicherweise nicht zum Verzehr empfohlen werden. Wiederholte Faelle von Ciguatera-Fischvergiftungen in der EU wurden mit dem Verzehr von falsch etikettierten importierten tropischen Fischen in Verbindung gebracht, vor allem dem Red Snapper Lutjanus malabaricus. Da die zugrundeliegenden Fischartenvertauschungen erst durch die daraus resultierenden schweren Krankheitssymptome dieser lebensmittelbedingten Krankheit an die Oeffentlichkeit gebracht wurden, haben wir eine erhebliche Dunkelziffer unentdeckter Artenvertauschungen mit den damit verbundenen Gesundheitsrisiken vermutet. Zum ersten Mal wurde die Artenidentitaet von 975 einzelnen Fischen, die am Frankfurter Flughafen aus verschiedenen Herkunftslaendern in die EU importiert wurden, mit ihrem potenziellen Risiko, eine Ciguatera-Vergiftung zu verursachen, ueber einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren korreliert. Auf der Grundlage einer DNA-Sequenzanalyse und einer begleitenden Begutachtung von Probenfotos wurde eine Gesamtfehlerkennungsrate von 31 % ermittelt, die je nach Fischfamilie massiv zwischen 0 % und 100 % variierte. Auch wenn die Stichproben nicht streng zufaellig gezogen wurden, deutet dies auf einen massiven Austausch von Fischarten bereits in fruehen Stadien der Wertschoepfungskette in der EU und ueber lange Zeitraeume hinweg hin. Unter dem Gesichtspunkt des Gesundheitsrisikos war das Vorkommen von Ziguatera-gefaehrdeten Arten in der Kohorte der DNA-identifizierten Ersatzfische dramatisch hoeher als bei den korrekt gekennzeichneten Fischen (46 % gegenueber 17 %). Da unsere Stichprobe weitgehend die standardisierten offiziellen Importverfahren zur Fischkennzeichnung widerspiegelt, deuten diese Zahlen darauf hin, dass der Import von falsch gekennzeichneten tropischen Fischen, insbesondere von Schnappern (Lutjanidae) und Zackenbarschen (Serranidae), ein unterschaetztes Gesundheitsrisiko fuer die Verbraucher von Meeresfruechten in Europa darstellt."

The samples are from the countries: Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Ukraine. At each location ten individual trees were collected. The data set includes the location ID and geographic coordinates of each sampled tree (longitude and latitude in decimal degrees) and the genotype data. All samples were screened with a targeted sequencing approach on a set of 381 polymorphic loci (356 nuclear SNPs, 3 nuclear InDels, 17 chloroplast SNPs and five mitochondrial SNPs). The genotype of each individual is one row in the csv-file 'genotypes'. The genotypes at the nuclear markers are diploid and represented by two columns per gene marker. The genetic information at the organelle genome is haploid. For each of these gene markers one column is used. Genotypes are coded by Arabic numbers. The meaning of the numbers is explained in the table 'coding genotypes' in a second csv-file. Methods The majority of the samples (188 locations) were collected in forest stands and for nine locations the material has been collected in provenance trials. For the sampling in the forests we set a minimum diameter of 20 cm at breast height and trees separated by a minimum of 50m to reduce the probability to collect related trees. At each location ten individual trees were collected. All samples were screened with a targeted sequencing approach on a set of 381 polymorphic loci (356 nuclear SNPs, 3 nuclear InDels, 17 chloroplast SNPs and five mitochondrial SNPs). The details of the used gene markers are given by Degen et al. (2021). Usage Notes The genotype of each individual is one row in the csv-table 'genotypes'. The genotypes at the nuclear markers are diploid and represented by two columns per gene marker. The genetic information at the organelle genome is haploid. For each of these gene markers one column is used. Genotypes are coded by Arabic numbers. The meaning of the numbers is explained in the csv-table 'coding genotypes'."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The study aimed to investigate the effect of crop diversification measures (cover crops, ley farming, vegetation stripes) on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and its potential link to SOC accrual in agricultural soils across Europe. The central hypothesis was that the crop diversification treatment results in more efficient microbial use of C, thus enhancing the potential of soils to store C. The effect of treatment was expected to vary between seasons. Topsoil was sampled from eight experimental crop diversification sites across a pan-European pedoclimatic gradient (Sweden, Netherlands, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Austria, France, Slovenia, and Spain). At five sites, a second sampling was conducted to test the effect of season on CUE (Sweden, Netherlands, France, Slovenia, and Spain). CUE was assessed by the 18O-labelling method. To account for the different experimental layout between sites, a meta-analysis approach was used for statistical analysis. To test for a general pattern of the seasonal variation in CUE across the pedoclimatic gradient, weather data (representing 3-months weather prior sampling) was used to extract seasonal predictors. For further details, please see the peer-reviewed publication. The R code was developed under R v4.4.0. The repository includes the following files: data: EJP-EL_COORD_sites.csv - Provides coordinates, reference system, land use, diversification treatment and year of establishment for the experimental sites (n=8).

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The German Fruit Genebank has been established as a decentralized network aiming at the coordination of the different germplasm collections in Germany to minimize the risk of losing fruit genetic resources (https://www.deutsche-genbank-obst.de/). Projects characterizing the genetic resources on trueness-to-type based on pomological and molecular characters are of main importance. First step is the characterization based on pomological characters. At least two experts, preferably members of the German Pomological Society, perform the pomological characterization. Second step of the characterization is a molecular DNA fingerprint analysis. Therefore, the European Collaborative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR; http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/) working group Prunus recommended a standard set of microsatellite (SSR) markers and a list of standard genotypes (references), which is routinely used. The Federal Office for Agriculture and Food on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture financially supports both steps: FKZ: 2809BE007, 2809BE011, 2816BE002, 2816BE004. The genetic analysis was performed using 16 microsatellite (SSR) markers recommend by the ECPGR. Respective loci were amplified using three multiplex PCR assays and the generated fragments were subjected to capillary electrophoresis. 3,500 samples (fruits/ leaves) of cherry trees belonging to the German Fruit Genebank from six network collections were investigated. 383 different fingerprints could be estimated for sweet cherry by statistical analysis and 341 of them (89 %) could be determined in pomological terms."

      "dsDescription": [
        {
          "dsDescriptionValue": "The fertility in sweet cherry is determined by a gametophytic self-incompatibility system, controlled by a multi-allelic S locus who prevents self-pollination. The fertilization is controlled by the interaction of an S allele specific ribonuclease (S-RNase) in the style with a pollen S specific F-box protein gene (SFB). Knowledge about the S genotype of sweet cherries is very important for cherry growers and breeders. In the last years molecular markers have been developed to distinguish the S alleles in sweet cherries. In the new update from October 2020 a total of 63 incompatibility groups in 1483 sweet cherries have been defined. 26 sweet cherries have a unique combination of S alleles and were described as universal donors and placed in the incompatibility group 0. Additionally, there exist 91 self-compatible sweet cherries, called group SC. A total of 22 different S alleles are described in the cultivated sweet cherries up to date. These are the S alleles S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S9, S10, S12, S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19, S21, S22, S24, S27, S30, S37. The goal of this work is to summaries all known data of the S alleles in cultivated sweet cherries. In Table 1 the S genotypes of all studied sweet cherries are described. Furthermore it includes information about the parentage if they are known. Table 2 gives an overview about all the detected incompatibility groups. The groups are sorted according to the group numbers and the S allele numbers, respectively. In Table 3 all genotypes of the incompatibility group 0 with a unique S genotype are listed. Table 4 includes all known self-compatible sweet cherries. All references to the information of the S genotypes are listed in a file named 'References'. The present update needs to be further improved with all new S alleles data of sweet cherries. In addition, all new information about the parentage is very important for the breeding research. Please send all new or corrected data to the S alleles and the parentage of sweet cherries to mirko.schuster@julius-kuehn.de. An update of the S allele overview will take place in the next years."

        {
          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains the field evaluation data and data from two artificial inoculation experiments for the evaluation of Malus genetic resources for apple blotch disease. Apple blotch, caused by the fungus, Diplocarpon coronariae, is an economically important disease in organic apple production in Europe. The disease, which occurs worldwide, was first described on leaves of Malus coronaria in Wisconsin, USA. Symptoms of apple blotch are black spots on apple leaves followed by leaf chlorosis and finally severe defoliation before fruit harvest. This weakens the physiological condition of the host, resulting in long-term reduced tree vigour and decreased yields. Currently, apple blotch appears in apple-growing regions in South Germany, Switzerland, Southern Austria and Northern Italy. The only effective method to control the disease is the application of fungicides, which is restricted in organic production. Cultivation of apple blotch-resistant cultivars is a desirable strategy to control the disease but little is known about the resistance of Malus genetic resources. We evaluated the Malus wild species accessions of the gene bank collection from the Julius Kuehn-Institut for field incidence of apple blotch (Occurence of D. coronariae JKI 2014_15_16_18.csv) and leaf fall (Leaf fall wild species JKI 2015_16_18.csv) over a time period of four years. To confirm the field observations, only leaves of accessions without symptoms were tested by artificial inoculation with spores of D. coronariae in a laboratory assay. The necrotic leaf area was measured 14 days post inoculation (dpi) using the leaf doctor application (Artificial inoculation D. coronariae_wild species.csv). Most of the evaluated cultivars were susceptible and developed symptoms after inoculation with D. coronariae. Information about the resistance/susceptibility of Malus genetic resources to apple blotch is still insufficient. The data obtained will provide insight into potential resistance donors, which can be used in future breeding programs."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The dataset contains the raw data of several experiments for the evaluation of raspberry genetic resources towards oviposition of spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii). The data was generated in frame of the project 'Evaluation of raspberry and strawberry genetic resources for resistance to spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) as base for the supply of resistance cultivars to German fruit production' from 2016 to 2019. The spotted-wing drosophila (SWD) is an invasive insect, which infest thin-skinned berries as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries and currants. Females of Drosophila suzukii attack fresh, ripe fruit by using their saw-shaped ovipositor to lay eggs under the fruit's skin. The infestation occurs previously before fruit harvest and larval development makes the fruits unusable for marketing. The control of D. suzukii is difficult, due to restrictions of pesticide application before harvest. Recent literature reported different raspberry cultivar preferences of D. suzukii. One possibility of sustainable control of D. suzukii could be the cultivation of low susceptible varieties in soft fruits. Development of low susceptible varieties for breeding requires the evaluation and identification of donors possible for breeding purposes. The evaluation of existing genetic resources (varieties and wild species) is the basis for future breeding programs or cultivation practise. The aim of the project is the detection of phenotypic differences in susceptibility against D. suzukii in genetic resources of raspberry. Low susceptible varieties can then be used for breeding or recommended to German growers. We tested the oviposition of D. suzukii to the raspberry cultivar Glen Ample in seven experiments to test reproducibility of the method (raw_data_rubus_larvae_SWD__test_establishment_2017.csv). Different ripening stages were evaluated for oviposition preference to D. suzukii (raw_data_rubus_larvae_SWD__ripening stage_201618.csv). A total of sixty raspberry cultivars were evaluated for oviposition preference (raw_data_rubus_larvae_SWD_20161718). Moreover, the sugar content and citric acid as well as the firmness were evaluated and used for a correlation analysis to mean number of larvae (raw_data_rubus_sweetness and titratable citirc acid_201718.csv; raw_data_rubus_firmness_201718.csv)."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Background Dumped munitions in German coastal waters, particularly the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), may pose significant environmental risks. TNT and its metabolites, such as 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT), contaminate marine organisms, particularly fish. These TNT metabolites bioaccumulate in fish tissues, serving as markers for environmental monitoring. Traditionally, fish bile has been a primary matrix to investigate TNT exposure; however, the present study is the first to explore the use of fish urine to detect TNT metabolites. Three flatfish species, common dab (Limanda limanda), European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) from three regions with munition dumping sites in the Western Baltic Sea were investigated. Results Differences in the levels of contamination at the dumping sites are reflected in the concentrations of explosives found in the bile and urine. Fish from the Kolberger Heide dumping site in Kiel Bight exhibited the highest concentrations of explosive contaminants. In individual dab, contamination with 2-ADNT (4-ADNT) was recorded up to 26.356 ng/ml (95.908 ng/ml) in bile and 36.120 ng/ml (26.877 ng/ml) in urine. The patterns of TNT metabolites in urine and bile vary, and the concentrations of these metabolites in urine and bile do not always correspond in individual fish. However, the different mean contamination levels in the three regions are reflected in both: urine and bile. Contamination levels of explosives in the three regions decrease in the order Kiel > Schlei > Luebeck. Conclusions TNT metabolites have been detected in fish urine for the first time. Urine and bile serve as useful matrices for assessing environmental exposure of fish to TNT. Additionally, dab and plaice can be utilized together in studies focusing on the analysis of explosives in bile or urine. The study supports the development of reliable and effective monitoring strategies for explosives, particularly for remediation efforts."

In the second study N supply was only ca. 190 kg N ha-1. The datasets of the two studies assembled herein contain data on weather, management, soil condition, soil moisture, phenology, dry weights and N concentrations of the plant (leaves, stems ears), green area index, stem reserves, final grain yield and yield components as well as canopy temperatures (this only applies to the second study). Most of the experimental findings have already been published in scientific journals. Data provided herein are suited to validate the interaction of elevated CO2 concentration and either N supply or high temperature during grain filling in wheat growth models."

In the second year soil cover was also varied to test whether mitigation of evaporation by straw mulch increases the CO2 effect on water use efficiency. The datasets assembled herein contain data on weather, management, soil condition, soil moisture, phenology, dry weights and N concentrations of the plant (leaves, stems, cobs), green leaf area index, stem reserves, final yield and quality-related traits in the total plant and grains. Most of the experimental findings have already been published in scientific journals. Moreover, the data have been used in two crop modeling studies, and simulation results (on soil moisture, transpiration, evaporation and biomass) of one of these studies are also shown here."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Rye (Secale cereale L.) is an important cereal crop in Northern Europe and known for its outstanding tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress including drought. Although the application of next generation sequencing increased the genomic resources for rye significantly, only limited knowledge is yet available on transcripts involved in drought stress tolerance. To identify and map respective genes, transcription profiling combined with in silico mapping of drought-regulated transcripts was performed. Two elite inbred lines of a German hybrid breeding program were exposed to drought under controlled conditions. RNA-seq was performed on cDNA libraries from leaves and from a bulk comprising flag leaves, ears and shoots, respectively. Each of these libraries was derived from both, a stressed and a well-watered variant, resulting in four libraries per genotype, i.e. eight libraries in total. The resulting sequence information supplemented the expressed sequence tag (EST) resource available for rye with 128,010 contigs (S1.fasta). Gene expression was quantified by DeepSuperSAGE tag-based transcription profiling and the response to stress of 47,842 transcripts was determined with respect to drought treatment, genotype and tissue (S3.tsv). In addition, 19,826 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) between the two genotypes (S2.tsv) were detected in 4,437 of the differentially expressed genes (S4.fasta). The chromosomal location of 2,869 transcripts was predicted by comparative mapping using the genome zipper linear gene order model of cereals (S5.tsv). The gene expression data and polymorphisms established here provide a deeper insight in the molecular basis of drought stress response in rye (S6.tsv) and will help to further promote breeding for abiotic stress tolerance in rye and in closely related important cereals. To evaluate the data a bi-parental population was genotyped with the marker resource and phenotyped. Subsequently a genetic map was built (S7.tsv), and a QTL mapping conducted to prove the value of the newly developed resource."

      "dsDescription": [
        {
          "dsDescriptionValue": "Metagenomics is a valuable diagnostic tool to enhance microbial food safety because (i) it enables the untargeted detection of pathogens, (ii) it is fast since primary isolation of microorganisms is not required, and (iii) it has high resolving power on nucleic acid level allowing for a detailed characterization of pathogens. For shotgun metagenomics, total nucleic acids are isolated from complex samples such as foodstuff. Along with microbial NAs high amounts of matrix NAs are extracted that in turn might outcompete microbial NAs during next-generation sequencing and lead to a decreased sensitivity for the detection of low abundant microorganisms. Sensitive laboratory methods are particularly indispensable to detect highly-pathogenic foodborne bacteria like Brucella spp. because only a low infectious dose is needed to cause human disease through the consumption of contaminated dairy or meat products. In our study, we applied shotgun metagenomics sequencing for the identification and characterization of Brucella spp. in artificially and naturally contaminated raw milk from various ruminants. With the depletion of eukaryotic cells prior to DNA extraction, Brucella was detectable at very low numbers while at the same time microbiological culture and isolation of the fastidious bacteria commonly failed. Simultaneously, we detected several other zoonotic pathogens, antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors in the examined raw milk samples. Last but not least, we were able to retrieve the genotype of a Brucella isolate from a metagenomics dataset, indicating the potential of metagenomics for outbreak investigations using SNP and cgMLST typing. In this way, we developed a new approach for strain prediction based on SNPs to identify the correct species and define a specific strain with only low amounts of genus-specific reads per sample. In summary, our study showed that metagenomics is a highly sensitive tool for biological risk assessment of foodstuffs, particularly when pathogen isolation is hazardous or challenging."

The aim of the scoping review is to identify definitions and methodological approaches used for the quantification of substitution effects for application in a bioeconomy monitoring framework. The scoping review was conducted guided by the 27-item checklist framework indicated on the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews, PRISMA-ScR. It searched for literature in two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) using bioeconomy-related search strings and keywords and spanning twenty-two and a half years (after 1999 until 2022) of scientific literature. The final selection includes 57 peer-reviewed articles published in English. The material includes the data extraction template, identification information from each article, summarized data extracted from articles as these relate to research questions and objectives of this review, verbatim explicit and implicit definitions as these were presented in the selected articles, as well as the displacement factors (from literature or authors` estimations) employed by the authors to analyze substitution effects."

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2018. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

Zudem ist die organische Bodensubstanz ein zentraler Indikator fuer Bodenfruchtbarkeit. Um die Vorraete an organsicher Bodensubstanz und erklaerende Kenngroessen erstmalig flaechendeckend und repraesentativ fuer Deutschland zu erheben, wurde das Thuenen Institut fuer Agrarklimaschutz vom Bundesministerium fuer Ernaehrung und Landwirtschaft mit der Durchfuehrung der ersten Bodenzustandserhebung Landwirtschaft beauftragt. Im Projektzeitraum 2009-2018 (Jacobs et al., 2018) wurden 3104 Standorte in einem Raster von 8x8 km beprobt. Der hier veroeffentlichte Kerndatensatz umfasst die wichtigsten in Labor und Feld erhobenen Daten der Bodenzustandserhebung Landwirtschaft (BZE-LW). Der Datensatz besteht aus drei verschiedenen Teilen mit dazugehoerigen readme-Dateien zur Erlaeuterung der Parameter: LABORDATEN.xlsx: Dieser Teildatensatz enthaelt alle relevanten Laborergebnisse. STANDORT.xlsx: Dieser Teildatensatz enthaelt die wichtigsten allgemeinen Informationen ueber den Beprobungszeitpunkt, den Standort, den beprobten Bodentyp und die Lage des Bodenprofils im Relief. HORIZONTDATEN.xlsx: Dieser Teildatensatz enthaelt die Horizontabfolge der angetroffenen Bodenprofile, sowie einige wichtige beschreibende Parameter.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "The Federal Republic of Germany is obliged to report all anthropogenic sources and sinks of greenhouse gases on a national scale. Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are among these sources and sinks. Furthermore, soil organic matter is a key indicator of soil fertility. The Thuenen Institute of Climate-Smart Agriculture was commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture to conduct the first German agricultural soil inventory and obtain a first representative and consistent baseline of SOC stocks in agricultural soils across Germany. Potential explanatory variables were also assessed. Between 2009 and 2018, a total of 3104 field sites were sampled in a 8x8 km grid (Jacobs et al., 2018). The dataset contains the key data (laboratory and field) of the first German agricultural soil inventory. It consists of three parts with associated readme-files, which explain the data: LABORATORY_DATA.xlsx: This file contains all relevant laboratory results. SITE.xlsx: This file contains the most important general information on the sampled sites. HORIZON_DATA.xlsx: This file contains the soil profile description as determined in the field with several key horizon parameters. In SITE.xlsx and HORIZON_DATA.xlsx, several parameters were determined using the German soil description guidelines (Ad-Hoc-Ag Boden, 2005) and are not explained here in detail. Single parameters, such as soil texture class or carbonate content class/ carbonate content are given in LABORATORY_DATA.xlsx and HORIZON_DATA.xlsx and can slightly deviate due to different methodologies (Estimation of soil scientist vs. laboratory analysis). Methodological details can be found in the Thuenen Report 64. References Ad-Hoc-Ag Boden (2005) Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung. E.Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Hannover.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Recent studies have uncovered patterns of genomic divergence in marine teleosts where panmixia due to high gene flow has been the general paradigm. These signatures of divergent selection are often impacted by structural variants, acting as 'supergenes' facilitating local adaptation. The highly dispersing European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa)--in which putative structural variants (i.e., inversions) have been identified--has successfully colonized the brackish water ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Thus, the species represents an ideal opportunity to investigate how the interplay of gene flow, structural variants, natural selection, past demographic history, and gene flow impacts on population (sub)structuring in marine systems. Here, we report on the generation of an annotated draft plaice genome assembly in combination with population sequencing data--following the salinity gradient from the Baltic Sea into the North Sea together with samples from Icelandic waters--to illuminate genome-wide patterns of divergence. Neutral markers pointed at large-scale panmixia across the European continental shelf associated with high gene flow and a common postglacial colonization history of shelf populations. However, based on genome-wide outlier loci, we uncovered signatures of population substructuring among the European continental shelf populations, i.e., suggesting signs of ongoing selection. Genome-wide selection analyses (xp-EHH) and the identification of genes within genomic regions of recent selective sweeps--overlapping with the outlier loci--suggest that these represent the signs of divergent selection. Our findings provide support for genomic divergence driven by local adaptation in the face of high gene flow and elucidate the relative importance of demographic history versus adaptive divergence in shaping the contemporary population genetic structure of a marine teleost. The role of the putative inversion(s) in the substructuring--and potentially ongoing adaptation--was seemingly not substantial."

Solanum scabrum is an African indigenous leafy vegetable, which is rich in proteins and micronutrients and could therefore contribute to a healthy diet. In this study, we investigated the fermentation of African nightshade as a post-harvest processing method which could contribute to reduce post-harvest losses. We inoculated the two selected lactic acid bacterial starter strains L. plantarum BFE 5092 and L. fermentum BFE 6620 with 106-107 cfu/ml. An uninoculated control was performed for each fermentation. The microbiota was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic methods. The dataset also includes an annotation file that is providing additional information such as units and decoding of used abbreviations. The dataset consists of two txt files with data and annotations. 1 folder containing v3/v4 16S-HTS-Raw Data."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Impact assessments for agriculture are partly based on projections delivered by models. Sectoral policies are becoming more and more interrelated. Hence, there is a need to improve the capacity of current models, connect them or redesign them to deliver on an increasing variety of policy objectives, and to explore future directions for agricultural modelling in Europe. SUPREMA (SUpport for Policy RElevant Modelling of Agriculture) is a project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (under grant agreement No 773499 SUPREMA) and that came to address this challenge by proposing a meta-platform that supports modelling groups linked already through various other platforms and networks. SUPREMA should help close the gaps between expectations of policy makers and the actual capacity of models to deliver relevant policy analysis. The SUPREMA model family includes a set of 'core models' that are already used in support of key European impact assessments in agriculture, trade, climate and bioenergy policies. One of the work-packages of the project ('Testing the SUPREMA model family') had the objective of testing the SUPREMA model family comparing model outcomes of three applications, including: (i) harmonize baseline assumptions and to the extent possible align baseline projections across models in the platform, and (ii) showcase the potential of the models in the meta-platform to respond to the upcoming and existing policy needs by means of two exploratory policy scenarios. This open dataset includes 3 components: 1 - (Baseline scenario) - the harmonized baselines (for 2030 and 2050). Please note that the baseline projections do not take into account the 2020 and possible future effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 2 - (Agricultural policy scenario) - medium-term horizon scenarios aiming comparing different models and/or model combinations, that have a large degree of 'similarity' such as joined indicator variables, i.e.: AGMEMOD-MITERRA (combined) modelling tool and the CAPRI model. The main focus was comparing model results in both agronomic and biophysical domains. Two variants of the agricultural policy scenario have been simulated and compared: (i) a CAP greening scenario; and (ii) a sustainable diet scenario. Both scenarios are hypothetical but have been chosen in such a way that the can provide insights in future policy issues as: (i) a further greening of the CAP fits in the policy implementation space as it is included in the ongoing policy reform of the CAP after 2020; and (ii) as increasing consumer awareness about healthy diets and their relation to meat consumption, as well as the footprint/climate consequences are highly relevant with respect to the Green Deal roadmap (December 2019) and the Farm to Fork Strategy (May 2020) documents that have been recently published. 3 - (Climate change mitigation scenario) - scenarios that quantifies the GHG mitigation potential of the EU's agricultural sector and domestic and global impacts of the EU policy, conditional on different levels of GHG mitigation efforts in the rest of the world. These are obtained through the SUPREMA models CAPRI, GLOBIOM and MAGNET and include scenarios where the EU only takes ambitious unilateral climate action up to scenario where the 1.5 C target is pursued globally SUPREMA has been coordinated by Wageningen Research with the participation of EuroCARE, Thuenen Institute, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) and Research Executive Agency (REA), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM)."

Das Cluster Forst & Holz besteht aus der Forstwirtschaft und nachgelagerten Wirtschaftszweigen, die vom Rohstoff Holz abhaengig sind. Daten fuer die Fortwirtschaft werden Berechnungen entsprechend des European Forest Accounts (TI-WF) entnommen. Fuer die holzbe- und -verarbeitenden Wirtschaftszweige werden amtliche Daten des Statistischen Bundesamtes (Destatis) und der Arbeitsagentur fuer Arbeit (Bafa) verwendet. Beschaeftigungsdaten werden ueber jaehrliche Sonderabfragen fuer die relevanten Wirtschaftszweige, unterteilt nach sozialversicherungspflichtiger und anderweitig geringfuegiger Beschaeftigung fuer Gesamtdeutschland und die Bundeslaender abgefragt. Daten zu Umsatz und Anzahl der Unternehmen werden den amtlichen Umsatzsteuervoranmeldungen (Destatis Code 73311) entnommen. Die Berechnung der Wertschoepfung basiert auf Daten der Struktur- und Kostenstrukturerhebungen (Fachserie 4, Reihen 4.3 und 5.3, Fachserie 9 Reihen 4.2 und 4.6). Die Fachserien sind online abrufbar unter https://www.statistischebibliothek.de/mir/content/index.xml Berichtszeitraum: 2000 bis 2020"

In der Beizsaison Sommer 2019 schrieben die Verbaende 32 Beizanlagen an. Es wurde um die Einsendung von Weizen- und Gerstenproben mit den Mitteln Landor CT, Celest, Vibrance Trio, Rubin TT und EfA gebeten. 138 Proben von 23 Beizstellen fliessen in die Auswertung mit ein. Gemessen wurden der Staubabrieb mit der Heubachmethode sowie der Wirkstoffgehalt im Staub mittels HPLC. Die Methode zur \u201eHeubach a.i.-Werte' Ermittlung beruht auf der Wirkstoff Extraktion aus dem anfallenden Staubabrieb der Heubach Messung. Hierbei wurden je nach Beizmittel die Fraktionen: Filter und Dichtring oder Filter, Dichtring und Filterkoerper extrahiert. Die Extrakte wurden mittels HPLC-DAD auf ihren Wirkstoffgehalt der einzelnen Aktiv-Substanzen hin untersucht. Die Wirkstoffgehalte der einzelnen Aktiv-Substanzen und den einzelnen Fraktionen wurden summiert und ueber die Einwaage des Heubachtest auf die Zielgroesse mg (Summe a.i.)/180 kg Saatgut bezogen. Um den Wirkstoff im Staub vollstaendig zu erfassen und Wirkstoffverschleppungen zu vermeiden, musste die Heubachmethode weiterentwickelt werden."

A ring test was initiated by the seed unions. 32 seed treatment facilities were contacted by the unions during the treating season in summer 2019. They were asked to send samples of wheat and barley treated with following products: Landor CT, Celest, Vibrance Trio, Rubin TT, EfA. For 138 samples from 23 seed treatment facilities dust abrasion was measured with the Heubach method. The active ingredient content in the dust (Heubach a.i.) was analysed with HPLC. To analyse the active ingredient in the dust depending on the product the fractions: filter and rubber O-ring or filter, rubber O-ring and filter housing were extracted. The amount of the single active ingredients in the extracts was analysed with HPLC-DAD. The single active ingredients and the different fractions were summed up to mg (Sum a.i.)/180kg seeds via the initial weight in the Heubach test. To capture the entire active ingredient in the dust and to avoid carryover of active ingredients the Heubach method had to be further developed."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Sour rot is a disease complex that causes serious damage in viticulture. The common vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is associated with sour rot in overripe or otherwise damaged grapes. Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is an invasive species, which is suspected to induce sour rot in previously undamaged grapes due to the flies' ability to infest healthy, undamaged soft fruits with its serrated ovipositor. As a consequence, infection of healthy grapes by D. suzukii may facilitate the colonization by D. melanogaster. The aim of this study was to investigate the single and combined influence of D. suzukii and D. melanogaster on sour rot development under near-natural conditions in the vineyard, along with laboratory experiments under controlled climate. For that, manipulative experiments with gauze-bagged grapes comprising four different treatments: 1) D. suzukii, 2) D. melanogaster, 3) both Drosophila species combined and 4) without flies as control were performed in 2017 and 2018. Subsequently, sour rot development was determined by measuring the volatile acidity levels. All experiments were performed around the harvest, started with the adding of the flies and ended with the determination of the volatile acid levels (as an indicator for sour rot). Field experiments were set up in a randomized block design: Blocks comprised four different treatments and were repeated 10 times and randomly distributed over the vineyard. For the laboratory experiments, the same experimental set up was chosen with four treatments repeated 10 times and randomly distributed in the climatic chamber. Therefore, one grape cluster per sample was placed in a plastic box. For all experiments n = 40 samples (4 treatments x 10 replicates) were used to check for differences in volatile acidity levels between the treatments performing variance analyses followed by post hoc tests. The raw data supporting the results in the paper are presented in three datasets referring to the five figures in the publication. A legend, explaining the different variables used in the datasets is given in a separate document. Dataset 1 is from the semi-field experiments in 2017 and underlies figure 1, 2 and 3 and related analyses. In two experimental repetitions starting at 30.8.2017 and 6.9.2017 and ending three weeks later at 20.9.2017 and 25.9.2017, grapes were exposed to the four different treatments in gauze sleeves in the field, followed by an incubation in the laboratory. In this experiment, additionally to the volatile acidity of the grape clusters, the fly emergence rates and grape cluster weight were determined. Dataset 2 is from the field experiments in 2018 and underlies figure 4 and related analyses. The experimental setup was same as in dataset 1, but the experiment took place completely in the vineyard. Again, two experimental repetitions were performed starting at 24.8.2018 and 31.8.2018 and ending with the determination of volatile acidity at 13.9.2018 and 20.9.2018. Dataset 3 is from the laboratory experiments in 2018 and underlies figure 5 and related analyses. For that, two laboratory repetitions were performed starting at 29.8.2018 and 4.9.2018 by placing one grape cluster per sample in a plastic box. The experimental setup was the same as in the field experiments with four treatments repeated 10 times and distributed randomly in the climatic chamber. The experiment ended after two weeks with the determination of volatile acidity of the grape cluster at 12.9.2018 and 29.9.2018 respectively."

Natural processes in forest trees are too slow to allow a sufficient adaptation, calling for active adaptation measures. Assisted migration, the facilitated movement of species and populations to match the climatic conditions anticipated in the future is suggested to be a key adaptation option to conserve the integrity of forest ecosystems and maintain their ecosystem functions. In the frame of the Interreg Central Europe project SUSTREE (Conservation and sustainable utilization of forest tree diversity in climate change), a policy brief has been written, to inform policy makers about assisted migration of forest trees and the seed transfer recommendations developed within SUSTREE. The key findings of the policy brief are: 1) The speed of climate change is faster than the natural pace of trees to adapt, calling for active management. 2) Assisted migration of forest seeds and seedlings enhances the resilience and reduces the vulnerability of European forests. 3) Seed transfer models based on Europe-wide experimental trials were developed to provide recommendations for assisted migration. 4) Stronger transnational coordination in seed management and tree breeding, as well as harmonization of national legislations, are required for Pan-European implementation of assisted migration. other languages: hungarian, slovak, polish, czech"

Da die natuerlichen Anpassungsprozesse von Waldbaeumen an den Klimawandel zu langsam ablaufen sind aktive Anpassungsmassnahmen dringend geboten. Assisted Migration, die vom Menschen aktiv unterstuetzte Wanderung von Baumarten und einzelnen Baumpopulationen, ist eine der zentralen Anpassungsmassnahmen, um die Integritaet der Waldoekosystem und deren Oekosystemleistungen zu erhalten. Im Rahmen des Interreg Central Europe Projektes SUSTREE (Schutz und nachhaltige Nutzung der Vielfalt von Waldbaeumen im Klimawandel) wurde ein Policy Brief erstellt, um Interessensvertretern die Moeglichkeiten von Assisted Migration fuer europaeische Waldoekosystem vorzustellen und die in SUSTREE entwickelten Saatguttransferempfehlungen einzufuehren. The Kernbotschaften des Policy Briefs sind: 1) Die Geschwindigkeit des Klimawandels ist schneller als die natuerliche Anpassungsfaehigkeit unserer Waldbaeume und verlangt aktive Anpassungsmassnahmen. 2) Assisted Migration von Baumsamen und Forstpflanzen erhoeht die Resilienz und reduziert die Gefaehrdung europaeischer Waelder. 3) Empfehlungen fuer Assisted Migration von Waldbaeumen basieren auf langjaehrigen Ergebnissen eines europaweiten Netzwerks aus bestehenden Samenherkunftsversuchen. 4) Fuer eine effektive, europaweite Umsetzung von Assisted Migration sind eine staerkere Koordination beim Management von Forstsamen und in der Forstpflanzenzuechtung sowie eine Harmonisierung Europaeischer und nationaler Gesetze noetig.

The Kernbotschaften des Policy Briefs sind: 1) Waldbaeume sind an das Klima ihrer Lebensraeume angepasst und besitzen Eigenschaften, die optimales Wachstum und Ueberleben unter stabilen Umweltbedingungen ermoeglichen. 2) Aufgrund des raschen Klimawandels koennen diese lokalen Anpassungen nicht mit den sich aendernden Umweltbedingungen Schritt halten. Die Gewissheit, dass lokale Baumbestaende und deren Saatgut immer die beste Wahl darstellen, verliert dadurch seine Gueltigkeit. 3) Die im Rahmen von europaeischen und nationalen Gesetzen festgelegten Herkunftsgebiete unterscheiden sich von Land zu Land. Sie geben nur bedingt die Klimabedingungen wieder und sind nicht geeignet, Waldumbau im Klimawandel zu unterstuetzen. 4) Zukuenftige Gesetzgebungen zur Wiederaufforstung und zum Saatguttransfer sollten daher die lokalen Anpassungen von Baumarten in deren gesamten Verbreitungsgebiet beruecksichtigen, um die genetischen Ressourcen von Baumarten im Klimawandel bestmoeglich zu schuetzen und zu nuetzen.

Additionally, landscape metrics from 2008 are provided based on modified versions of the biotope layers from the dataset 'Landscape heterogeneity metrics' (BExIS ID 24046). The metrics were calculated on circular buffers around Experimental Plots (EP) with radii of 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. Further, patch-level metrics and historical land-use/ land-cover type of the grassland sites on which the EP were located are included. The landscape metrics of this dataset are listed below. Patch-level metrics (only for the central patches containing the grassland EP): patch area, perimeter, shape index, nearest-neighbour distance, proximity index and Hanski index. Class-level metrics (calculated for each land use/ land cover class within circular buffers around EP): total class area, proportional class area, mean patch area, area-weighted mean patch area, patch number, total edge, edge density, mean shape index, mean nearest-neighbour distance, median proximity index, median Hanski index. Landscape-level metrics (calculated for the whole landscape within circular buffers around EP): patch density, edge density, Shannon diversity, Shannon evenness. For more information on the landscape metrics, please see the word document 'Metadata_LandMetrics' that is included in the zip folder of this dataset."

Die Grundlage der Ableitung der Standorts- und Bodeninformationen bildeten die in den Bundeslaendern zur Verfuegung stehenden Informationen aus der Standorts- und Bodenkartierung. Um den oft historisch gewachsenen Feinheiten der einzelnen Kartierungsverfahren gerecht zu werden, wurden Standorts- und Bodenkundler aus jedem Bundesland in das Projekt eingebunden. Fuer 26.450 Traktecken wurden Standorts- und Leitprofildaten nach einheitlichen Vorgaben erhoben und in der Datenbank zusammengefuehrt. Das Parameterspektrum umfasst im Wesentlichen: (1) Standortseinheit mit Bodentyp, Wasserhaushalts-/ Naehrstoffansprache, Kalkung, (2) Leitprofil mit obligatorischen Horizontangaben zu Bodenart, Skelett, Trockenrohdichte (TRD), nutzbare Feldkapazitaet (nFK), (3) Leitprofil mit fakultativen Horizontangaben zu Basensaettigung, organischer Kohlenstoffgehalt (Corg), Entkalkungstiefe, (4) Quellen- und Qualitaetsschluessel zu allen Parametern. Die Standortseinheit liegt fuer 25.069 (95 %) Traktecken vor, das Leitprofil fuer 24.735 (93.5 %).

Basis for the derivation of site and soil information at the inventory points were the site and soil maps of each federal state. To account for the particularities of each mapping system, experts in forest site mapping of each state were involved in the project. This way, forest site mapping and soil data for 26.450 inventory points were raised according to common specifications, and joined in the data base . The parameter spectrum consists in essence of: (1) Site unit with soil type, water and nutrient status, liming, (2) characteristic soil profile with obligatory data for each horizon on soil texture, soil skeleton, oven-dry density, and available water capacity, (3) characteristic soil profile with facultative data for each horizon on base saturation, organic C-content (Corg), decalcification depth, (4) source and quality key to all parameters. The site unit is documented for 25.069 (95 %) of the inventory points, the soil profile for 24.735 (93.5 %).

In total, 1150 individuals from 69 bee species were sampled in 2021 (1147 individuals identified on a species level), including 116 honeybee (Apis mellifera) individuals and 132 bumblebee (Bombus spp.) individuals. The list of sampled bee individuals contains information on sampling details (including sampling period, pan trap colour, pan trap diameter, site), as well as information on the collected bee individuals (including operational taxon, determined genus and species based on morphological identification, sex). A second data sheet contains information on the weight of bycatch (individuals other than bees (Apoidea: Apiformes)) per pan trap sample.

These conventions require annual calculations of the emissions of the respective gases and air pollutants. The results have to be documented in an emission inventory and to be reported to the organisations in charge. The data file contains input data and results of the calculation of gas and particulate emissions from German agriculture for Germany and the federal states in the years 1990 - 2017. In this context the sector Agriculture comprises the emissions from animal husbandry, the use of agricultural soils and anaerobic digestion of energy crops. As required by the guidelines, emissions from activities preceding agriculture, from the use of energy and from land use change are reported elsewhere in the national inventories."

The objective was to provide an overview of the TAG profile of Moroccan CO. The fatty acids in CO, mainly linoleic (Li), oleic (Ol), and palmitic (Pa), form the primary building blocks of the most abundant TAGs, which include LiLiLi, PaLiLi, LiLiOl, and PaLiOl. The relative proportions of these TAGs were found to be within the following ranges: LiLiLi (18.5-27.0%), PaLiLi (20.1-27.5%), LiLiOl (14.2-17.4%), and PaLiOl (10.2-12.6%). The findings provide valuable insights into the TAG composition of Moroccan cactus seed oil and serve as a foundation for further exploration and interpretation."

The objective was to provide a comprehensive overview of the fatty acid profile of Moroccan CO. The oil was predominantly characterized by unsaturated fatty acids, with linoleic acid (54.6-65.4%) being the most abundant, followed by oleic acid (13.0-23.0%) and palmitic acid (11.4-12.9%), which together accounted for approximately 90% of the total fatty acid composition. Additional fatty acids were also identified and reported. The data presented offer valuable insights into the fatty acid composition of Moroccan CO and serve as a foundation for further exploration and interpretation."

These assessments use the pesticide occurrence data generated under the official monitoring programs of Member States, the consumption data from EFSA's comprehensive food consumption database and pesticide-specific information such as processing factors. Currently no harmonised list of processing factors is available within Europe and worldwide. The overall objective of this project is to develop a database of validated processing factors, which is compatible with the EFSA food classification and description system FoodEx 2. In the first part of the project, a compendium of representative processing techniques was elaborated which serves as a standard description of all relevant processes and as a basis for validation of processing studies. In the second part of the project all relevant processes and raw and processed commodities were coded according to FoodEx2. In the third and last part of the project all processing studies used by EFSA in their Conclusions and Reasoned Opinions issued until 30/06/2016 were reevaluated according to uniform quality criteria and reported in a database. The database is provided as a flat Excel spreadsheet. Information on processing conditions, on analytical methods, storage stability and GLP was collected from the studies and was used to judge the acceptability of each processing study. The representativeness of the processing conditions applied in the studies was judged by comparing them to the compendium of representative processing techniques. Processing factors (PF) were derived from the studies according to comprehensible calculation rules and based on the residue definitions for monitoring. The individual PF were judged for their acceptability. For each commodity/process/active substance combination a median PF was calculated from the individual ones, based on the trials from one or more studies. The database is a ready-to-use inventory of PF for pesticides in a variety of processed food items. In a pilot project a second database was set up with processing factors based on the residue definition for dietary risk assessment. Extension of this database is recommended."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "A relatively recent invasive pest of soft-skinned fruits in Europe is Drosophila suzukii (Spotted wing drosophila - SWD). It has already caused severe economic damages in many fruit-crops and some susceptible grape varieties and seems to have successfully adapted to survive under a variety of conditions. The Julius Kuehn Institute (JKI) set up a primary monitoring program in 2011 in southwest Germany expecting the migration of SWD into Germany. Following its appearance in late summer 2011, the monitoring of SWD gathered more momentum with more traps and other institutes joining in the study. The online tool DrosoMon (http://drosomon.julius-kuehn.de/) was created to act as a hub for gathering and harmonizing the trap capture data from the SWD monitoring programs from different parts of Germany and Europe. DrosoMon also provides the means to visualize the data at trap levels and compare variations in captures between traps or with temperature and precipitation data from the nearest weather station. Here we present and publish the data from the JKI monitoring program from 2011 to February 2018. The data set of D. suzukii captures presented here comes from the monitoring study conducted by the Institute for Plant Protection in Fruit Crops and Viticulture, Dossenheim and Siebeldingen, and the Institute for Biological Plant Protection, Darmstadt of the JKI between 2011 and 2018. All monitoring sites are located in southwest Germany roughly within ~75 km radius near the institutes. The coordinates of the trap locations were recorded with a handheld-GPS ('lat' and 'lon' in the table/dataset). The sites were chosen randomly to represent different possible preferred sites of host plants or potential overwintering grounds in the immediate vicinity. The traps were installed in semi-natural habitats, mainly on hedges with wild host plants of D. suzukii, in the surroundings of the institutes. The trap designs were quite similar between the three institutes following the instructions in the JKI-flyer (https://drosophila.julius-kuehn.de/index.php?menuid=61 and in Briem et al. 2018) with minor variations. The traps were filled with a mixture of unfiltered apple cider vinegar (ACV) (acetic acid content 5 %) diluted with water. For more detailed information on the ingredients, the variations in trap designs between each monitoring group see the methods section in respective paper this data set relates on. The monitoring data set is provided as two tab-separated ascii tables: captures_data.txt and trap_description.txt. In the trap_description table, each record describes the characteristics and location of a single trap along with the baiting mixture used. In the captures_data table, each record describes the number of male and female D. suzukii from a single trap deployment, for each individual trap. The trap_description table lists 100 traps that were set during the monitoring period, the actual number of traps in operation varying over the years. The captures_data table contains 9967 records, each record representing a trap deployment. These deployments account for a total of 116,602 days and captured 756,717 adult D. suzukii individuals. The data were manually entered in the Drosomon database and checked for errors concerning dates and trap parameters."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Microsatellite primers were developed to promote studies on the patterns of genetic diversity within Patellifolia patellaris and the relationship between the three species of the genus Patellifolia. The genomic sequence from Patellifolia procumbens was screened for SSRs and 3648 SSRs were identified. A subset of 53 SSR markers was validated of which 25 proved to be polymorphic in the three species except for the P. webbiana-specific marker JKIPat16. A detailed description of the marker including GenBank accession numbers was published by Nachtigall et al. (2016) Applications in Plant Sciences 4(8):1600040 (DOI: 10.3732/apps.1600040). The SSR markers were applied to study the genetic differentiation between P. patellaris as well as P. procumbens/P. webbiana occurrences sampled on the Iberian Peninsula, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands (Frese et al., 2017, Euphytica 213:187 (DOI: 10.1007/s10681-017-1942-0), Frese et al., 2018 accepted). The marker set was used to study genetic diversity and genetic differentiation within the species. SSR data presented in excel file were generated by JKI in Quedlinburg, Germany. P. patellaris plants were sampled at 26 localities in 2015, analysed using 24 SSR markers, the raw data were binned and statistically analysed in 2016-2017. The first data sheet contains information on 581 plants in total. P. procumbens, P. webbiana were sampled in the same year at 7 locations, analysed using 22 SSR markers, the raw data were binned and statistically analysed in 2016-2017. The second data sheet contains information on 172 plants in total. Both dataset include null alleles which are coded as '999'."

The pesticide data presented here were acquired in four ditches in Lower Saxony, Germany (three ditches located in apple plantations, one ditch located in grassland) between 2001 and 2003. Two different monitoring strategies have been applied; event-driven sampling after pesticide applications and weekly integrated sampling using automatic water samplers. A total of 70 active substances have been monitored while farmers applied 25 active substances. LC-MS/MS (PE Sciex API 2000), GC-MS (Finnigan GCQ), GC coupled with electron capture detector (ECD) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) were used for identification and quantification of the target substances."

The database was developed with Microsoft Access Database 2007-2016 and stores 43 million records. Multi-variable data sets consists of gas fluxes (carbon dioxide, nitrous dioxide, methane and ammonia), crop parameters (ontogenesis, aboveground biomass, grain and straw yield, N and C content, etc.), soil characteristics (nitrogen content, ammonium-N, nitrate-N, bulk density etc.), continuously recorded meteorological variables (air and soil temperatures, radiation, precipitation, etc.), management activities (sowing, harvest, soil tillage, fertilization, etc.), and its metadata (methods, further information about variables, etc.). In addition, N2 data were measured and analyzed. Also available are site-specific calculated C and N balances for the respective crops and crop rotations."

      "dsDescription": [
        {
          "dsDescriptionValue": "The fertility in sweet cherry is determined by a gametophytic self-incompatibility system, controlled by a multi-allelic S-locus who prevents self-pollination. The fertilization is determined by the interaction of an S-allele specific ribonuclease (S-RNase) in the style with a pollen S specific F-box protein gene (SFB). Knowledge about the S genotype of sweet cherries is very important for cherry growers and breeders. In the last years molecular markers have been developed to distinguish the S- alleles in sweet cherries. A total of 60 incompatibility groups in 1203 sweet cherries have been defined up to October 2017. 25 sweet cherries have a unique combination of S-alleles and were described as universal donors and placed in the incompatibility group 0. Additionally, there exist 72 self-compatible sweet cherries, called group SC. The goal of this work is to summaries all known data of the S-alleles in cultivated sweet cherries. In Table 1 the S-genotypes of all studied sweet cherries are described. Furthermore it includes information about the parentage if they are known. Table 2 gives an overview about all the detected incompatibility groups. The groups are sorted according to the group numbers and the S-allele numbers, respectively. In Table 3 all genotypes of the incompatibility group 0 with a unique S-genotype are listed. Table 4 includes all known self-compatible sweet cherries. All references to the information of the S-genotypes are listed in a file named 'References'. The present overview needs to be further improved with all new S-alleles data of sweet cherries. In addition, all new information about the parentage is very important for the breeding research. Please send all new or corrected data to the S-alleles and the parentage of sweet cherries to mirko.schuster@julius-kuehn.de. An update of the S-allele overview will take place every year."

Dieser jaehrlich erhobene Datensatz wird fuer eine Risikoabschaetzung nutzbar gemacht, indem die verkauften Pflanzenschutzmittelwirkstoffe auf die einzelnen zugelassenen Anwendungsgebiete verteilt und deren Anwendungsflaechen geschaetzt werden. Diese Anwendungsflaechen dienen als Gewichtungsfaktor bei der Aggregation der mit SYNOPS berechneten Risikowerte. Die fuer Anwendungsabschaetzung angewandte Methode wird hier beschrieben und die geschaetzten Anwendungsflaechen der einzelnen Anwendungen in den Jahren 1996-2015 in einer Ergebnistabelle zusammengefasst.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "This data set includes all correlations found between morphological and biochemical characteristics of five common medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP's) (Coriandrum sativum L. - coriander, Mentha spicata L. - spearmint, Ocimum basilicum L. - basil, Origanum vulgare L. - oregano and Petroselinum crispum Mill. - parsley). Pearson correlations were calculated using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 19.0 software (IBM Corporation, New York, U.S.A.). Data includes morphological measurements (Leaf Area - AREA, Leaf length - LENG, Leaf perimeter - PERI, Leaf shape factor - SFACT, SLA - SLA, Leaf width - WIDT) as well as several biochemical characteristics (Carotenoid content - CARO, Chlorophyll a content - CLA, Chlorophyll b content - CLB, Chlorophyll a/b ratio - CLA/CLB, Total Chlorophyll content - CLT, Total Chlorophyll/Carotenoid ratio - CLT/CARO, Non-structural carbohydrate content - NSCA, Protein content - PROT, Soluble Sugar content - SSUG, Soluble Sugar/Stach ratio - SSUG/STAR, Starch content - STAR, TBARS - TBARS, Total phenolic content - TPHE, Water content - WCON), all expressed per leaf fresh weight (mg/g or nmol/g) or area (mg/dm2 or nmol/dm2), with the exception of water content, expressed as %. Biometric characterization - For the characterization of morphological parameters of the leaves of the studied plants, ten healthy and totally expanded mature leaves were selected, and the WinDIAS Leaf Area Meter System software (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used for the recording of data (area, length, width and perimeter). Moisture content (WC) was determined by oven-drying at 70\u00baC until constant mass was obtained. Shape factor is defined as the ratio of the actual perimeter (P) to that of a circle with the same area (Pc) (SF=P/P_c ), while specific leaf area (SLA) is obtained using the relation leaf area/dry mass. For histological analysis, leaf cross sections of healthy leaves were prepared for optical microscope examination (Olympus Mod. 1X 51; Olympus Optical Co., GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), using an Olympus Colorview III camera. Leaves were prepared by fixation in FAA (formalin-acetic acid-alcohol, 5:5:90 v/v), for 24 hours. Afterwards, cross sections were placed in 70% ethanol, and dehydration was achieved by immersing them 1 hour, in increasing ethanol concentrations (70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%). Leaf samples were cleared by placing them in xylene, for 1 hour, after which it was embedded overnight in liquid paraffin, using a Leica EG1160 paraffin embedding station. The leaf material was cut using a Leica RM 2135 Rotary Microtome. De-paraffinization was performed using xylene, and hydration achieved by down-grading (100%-70%) ethanol solutions. Staining with toluidine blue (0.1% for 7 minutes) preceded washing with water and new dehydration with ethanol. A last clearing step was performed with xylene, and mounting was completed in Entellan (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Biochemical characterization - For the biochemical characterization of the studied plants, totally expanded mature leaves, from ten plants of each species were collected. From these leaves, ten 8 mm (diameter) discs were sampled. The discs were pooled, ground to a fine powder in a mortar with a pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Biochemical characterization was performed in six sub-samples of the ground leaves. For the quantification of photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll a (Cla), b (Clb) and total chlorophyll (Clt), and total carotenoids were spectrophotometrically determined from 80% acetone extracts, using the methods proposed by SEST\u00c1K et al. (1971) and LICHTENTHALER (1987), respectively. The quantification of soluble sugars was performed using the method described by IRIGOYEN et al. (1992). Briefly, ground leaf was extracted with 10 ml of 80% ethanol, at 80\u00baC, for 1 hour. Afterwards, 0.2 mL of the alcoholic extract and 3 mL of anthrone was added and the mixture was placed in a water bath at 100\u00baC, for 10 minutes. Following extraction, the solid fractions obtained in the soluble sugar quantification was used for the starch analysis. Extraction was performed using 30% perchloric acid (OSAKI et al., 1991) and quantification followed the anthrone procedure described in the soluble sugars methodology, using also glucose as standard. Total soluble proteins content was quantified as proposed by BRADFORD (1976). Leaf discs were ground in a buffer medium containing 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP), and centrifuged at 22000 g for 30 minutes, at 4 \u00baC. Absorbance was read at 595 nm, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a standard. The determination of total phenolics was performed in the same extracts used for the quantification of photosynthetic pigments. The methodology described by SINGLETON and ROSSI (1965) was followed, and quantification was achieved by spectrophotometric readings at 765 nm, using gallic acid as the reference standard, and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE's). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances determination (TBARS) was evaluated using the method described by BACELAR et al. (2006). Briefly, frozen leaf samples were ground with 2 mL of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) using a mortar and pestle. The mixture was centrifuged (3500 g; 20 minutes), and 1 mL of supernatant was combined with 1 mL 20% (w/v) TCA containing 0.5% (w/v) of thiobarbituric acid and 100 \u00b5L 4% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Thereafter, the mixture was heated at 95\u00baC for 30 minutes, cooled in an ice bath and again centrifuged at 10,000 X g for 10 minutes. The absorbance of the samples was obtained at 532 nm, whereafter the non-specific absorbance recorded at 600 nm was subtracted.

The project was supported by various institutions such as the German Hunting Association (DJV), the Bavarian Hunting Association (BJV), the Association of German Professional Hunters (BDB), the European Poultry, Egg and Game Wholesale and Import Society (EPEGA), the Federation of Hunting and Sport Weapon and Ammunition Manufacturers (JSM) and the University for Sustainable Development (HNEE). This data set includes detailed records on the killing of roe deer and wild boar during hunting- in order to determine the influencing factors of the length of the escape distance. The primary aim was to test whether the length of the escape distance of this both species is independent of the bullet material (lead or non-lead ammunition)."

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."

The video test was run in the German sector. Small fish sampling by means of dredge sampling and beam trawls was not undertaken due to time constraints. The data set contains fisheries data, demersal trawling, Doggerbank, North Sea ( 55.00\u00b0 N, 003.00\u00b0 E), comprising HH, HL and CA tables available in IBTS 'North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey' Format (DATRAS Format, see https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/ReportingFormat.aspx) and an extra file containing DATRAS headers.

          "dsDescriptionValue": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is one of currently two Essential Climate Variables related directly to permafrost regions as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ALT is determined as the maximum thaw depth at the end of the thawing season and is being monitored across the Arctic to better understand climate change impacts on landscape, permafrost, hydrology, vegetation, and soil biogeochemistry. In addition, spatially and/or temporally distributed measurements of thaw depth (TD) in the active layer during the thawing period are often recorded during field work in permafrost regions for various research purposes and process understanding. The ALLena dataset presents a compilation of thaw depth (TD) measurements of the active layer in the Lena River Delta region based on published and unpublished field data collected during Russian and joint German-Russian expeditions from 1998 to 2022. The dataset contains data from different areas of the Lena Delta region with clustering in research-intensive areas, e.g. in the vicinity of Research Station Samoylov Island, but also includes sites adjacent to the delta such as Muostakh Island, Bykovsky Peninsula and Tiksi settlement surroundings. The compiled data is distributed across various ecosystems and geomorphological units underlain by different types of deposits and characterized by various relief positions, microtopography, soil and vegetation cover (e.g. active floodplains, polygonal tundra on Holocene Lena Delta terraces, remnants of Yedoma Ice Complex, etc.). TD measurements were conducted as opportunistic single as well as targeted TD transects or grid measurements. For some sites measurements of TD were repeated at the same locations in different years. TD was measured one time per site or several times per site within a few centimeters to several meters to capture small-scale heterogeneity depending on e.g. microcrotopography or vegetation type. The main datatable (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.973813) contains discrete TD values if they were measured one to three times per site. In case of more than three TD values per measurement site, the main datatable provides the minimum, maximum, and mean TD as well as the number of measurements that were averaged. For sites with more than three TD measurements per site, separate detailed tables like this one are provided. The dataset presents a highly valuable compilation of TD data over a uniquely large Arctic region and long time span. It might complement the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program and other published ALT and TD datasets for other permafrost regions and may be used for e.g. parametrization or validation of permafrost modelling and remote sensing studies."
